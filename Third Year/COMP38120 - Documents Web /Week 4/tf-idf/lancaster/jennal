link brok long ago 
her mou twist wry at

lik a bit leg 
just the sight of the stamp had 
been enough to set her heart 
beat uneasy and she had to 
fight down the urg to put off 
read the word someon had writ

sheet of pap

bleak her ey almost mesm 
by the one nam  lemarchand 
how was it that aft so long 
that nam could strik out at 
her bring back the long 
lost desol the raw feel of 
reject 
ther wer no condol no 
flowery word noth but stark 
fact not ev the norm 
end 
he mer sign his nam at the 
bottom of the sheet firm 
black and impery 
alain lemarchand 
her moth fac cam swim 
into her mind blot out the 
sight of the mess from so far 
away 
it would nev be her fath 
fac that mat how could 
it be 
she had been eight year old and 
that was sixteen year ago 
ev if he look the sam she 
could not rememb him 
she on rememb her moth and 
the grief that the nam lemarchand 
had brought 
every instinct warn her to tear 
the let up to burn it 
to destroy it and nev think of 
it again 
her fath would not rememb her 
eith becaus she was no long eight 
year old and heartbrok 
why should he want to see her 
he had not want to see her 
ont in all the long year 
it took a gre ment effort to 
mov and go upstair to chang 
ev then she had to keep her 
mind blank and it was on 
as she cook the ev meal 
every act mech that she 
thought cle again 
how had thy man found her 
how did he know anyth about 
her 
until she was sixteen they had been 
const mov and ther had nev 
been anyon left behind to pass 
on her address 
her fath had nev both to 
find out so how had thy 
frenchm success 
it was too big a puzzl and 
she let it go although it gnaw 
away at the back of her mind 
should she go to frant 
a last request 
could she fac it in any cas 
without show the bit 
they said that every act of lif 
show on the fac in the 
express 
sur russel bry must hav som 
sign on him of his past lif 
then 
could a man who desert his wif 
and child for anoth wom get 
off fre without scar 
her moth had born scar 
she had been cold beauty until 
the day she died but noth 
had brought her happy 
she had laugh liv a 
perfect norm lif should the 
respons of being alon to bring 
up her daught but with a 
child uncanny insight jenn had 
known that her moth had nev 
recov 
when the init grief of the 
desert had pass she had known 
bet than to ment her fath 
nam 
she was told the fact 
russel bry had gon to frant 
to marry a french widow cal 
lemarchand 
he car noth for his wif and 
daught and they must wip him 
from their mind 
jenn had nev known if that

fath ord 
if it was he had certain 
follow it scrup himself 
not ont in the long year had 
he attempt to get in touch 
to correspond with a daught he 
had been all too ready to 
abandon 
and now he want to see her 
it seem almost a mockery a 
travesty of what should hav been 
in her teen year she had 
thought it out car 
she had seen her friend with their 
own fath and her mor mat 
outlook had pinpoint the crim 
ready 
peopl divorc left each oth 
 grown men and wom who 
reach the decid to part 
they clung to their childr 
though shar them eq 
neith partn prep to let

she had not been in that 
posit 
her own fath had left her 
ready left her to an 
uncertain fut his lov for som 
glam frenchwom overrid his lov 
and duty to his own child 
she had felt worthless doubl 
desert and had fin wip 
him from her mind on a 
faint bit left a 
hollow incomplet feel she would 
alway carry 
lemarchand 
and who was alain lemarchand 
a rel 
the wom broth 
did the wom herself feel too 
much guilt to writ 
jenn left the meal to keep hot 
and went to fresh up tel 
herself that she would consid it 
cold and then decid but in 
real she was churn up insid 
a desir to hid from thy 
uppermost but a deeps and 
almost morbid curios urg her to 
go to frant and see the man

jenn didnt expect so herself 
glyn had com yesterday but 
shirley had already cook and he

he felt that his job was quit 
sufficy 
she had nev ev expect him to 
help with the dish when she 
had fed him her 
somehow she would cop with the 
ev meal herself but she kept 
sil about it 
shirley thought littl of a man who 
couldnt turn his hand to

the bel rang bef she could 
op it and jenn stood just insid 
the sittingroom in her long 
houseco wond who on ear 
it could be the post had 
ar ov an hour ago and 
she didnt know enough peopl to

the const upheav of her lif 
had part her from any clos 
friend and her own quiet 
withdrawn man kept most peopl 
at arm leng 
as shirley op the door jenn 
stiff her tal slend fig 
held rigid stil the back of

his dark ey flash straight 
across the hal and pin jenn 
merciless 
mademoisel bry

then youd bet com

for the lif of her she 
couldnt mov and as shirley 
left her fac alight with 
enquiry jenn mot the tal 
dark strang to com into the 
sittingroom 
he clos the out door firm and 
turn to look at her again 
it was upset that he should 
hav ar on her very first real 
day back 
com out of hospit was traum 
enough without fac the accus 
man and shirley was quit right 
about the weak 
his glant rak her from head to 
foot bef he ev mov 
furth and she could see that he 
thought her very decad to be in 
her houseco at thy tim in the 
morn 
she had need to mak a real 
effort to get up today at all 
sometim she felt very tir 
thing had not gon too smooth in 
hospit and it was tak a long 
tim to recov 
that he had to pass fair 
clos to her mad jenna heart 
beat alarm and all she could 
think was that she wish she had 
phon and spar herself thy 
she had ev been going to writ 
today as soon as shirley had gon 
cle he had not been cont to 
wait and as she look at the 
hard handsom fac she knew he 
was fury angry on good 
man hold back the word that 
wer obvy uppermost in his 
mind 
insid the sittingroom he spun round 
on her stand across the room as 
if any contact with her would be 
an unpleas episod in his lif 
he look wealthy ass and 
he was beauty dress with the 
cas eleg of the men of his 
nat 
he must hav been wel ov six 
feet tal becaus jenn was not in 
any way smal but she felt it 
now 
his hair was almost black heavy 
and smooth groom swept back 
from a fac that was icy 
cold on the long 
humorouslook mou tel her that 
thy hostil was sol for her 
benefit and not som nat 
man 
you did not telephon and you

his let had not contain any 
regret for her forthcom ord 
and he did not look lik a man 
who would hav much paty with

he mad her feel shock vuln 
when she should hav been consum 
with annoy herself 
he had no right to tak thy 
attitud 
he look at her with exasp 
when she just gaz at him 
with wid deep blu ey

jenn hadnt real just how 
weak she felt until that mom 
and she kept a firm grip on 
the back of the set 
they had told her in hospit that 
the glass had cut into an artery 
and she had need transfus but 
although she had felt far from wel 
thy morn she was certain feel

her moth had died a very short 
tim ago in real and 
jenn had been mor than cap of

thy of cours is not the reason 
for thy littl chat

moth had divorc her fath becaus 
ther was anoth man in her 
lif

monsy lemarchand is being quit 
obstruct to my mind 
he went on grim 
in the norm cours of 
ev thes thing tak tim und 
french law and theyr lik 
to tak ev long in thy cas 
becaus he refus to mak any mov 
whatev until you are act ther 
 in frant 
why 
jenn found herself almost 
whisp 
she had been sec certain of 
her fact her lif built on 
the real of the past and 
now thing wer all tilt 
wav with a man she did 
not know issu ord that would 
tak her toward a plac she had 
no desir to visit 
she also felt as if she wer 
sit in front of a bespectac lun 
who was mak thing up as he 
went along 
he insist that you meet his 
moth and discuss thing  
reason 
then he can just go on 
wait jenn stat with a

it suit me to 
delay

reput art a fact you may 
not hav real 
in frant he was wel known and 
his work sought eag 
thy hous and land are not all 
that is left behind 
ther must be oth thing 
valu thing not least

he did not liv in an empty 
hous and som of thos

them be ther at any 
discuss 
you own part of his 
est 
is  is that why

press on you 
it had puzzl me origin but 
aft a quick word with glyn as

she had on told glyn about it 
on the way her

the urg desir to get out of

peopl seem to be arrang her

when glyn pres himself rath

chapt thre 
the hous was beauty and the

amount of french

i very car refrain from learn 
french 
his ey narrow at thy 
bit but he simply left 
the room and jenn had the 
feel that she had been as 
ungr as he appear to think 
she didnt understand thy man at 
all 
he seem to be a mixt of 
kind and mockery but it 
didnt mat very much 
she was her to fight him 
insid she knew her moth would 
hav want thy 
she had no int of being 
acceiv by thy famy 
she look down hasty at her own 
appear 
until now she hadnt giv it 
much thought 
she had been swept along by alain 
sint her plan land and now 
she was about to meet the wom 
whos glamo had brought her fath 
to frant who had driv him 
to desert his own wif and 
child 
french wom wer chic wel 
groom and if all the magazin 
wer to be believ they wer 
almost invary beauty 
she caught sight of herself in a 
long gilt mir and smooth her 
fair hair 
she was wear a mulberrycolo suit 
with a straight skirt and a short 
jacket 
it had travel wel and the 
colo emphas her aston 
fair 
she would just about do although 
she wish she had been abl to 
wear high heel 
if madam was lik her 
son then she would be as tal 
as a tre 
high heel wer out for now 
though she felt shaky enough as 
it was 
she turn to the door almost 
shiv with nerv as she heard 
the rapid flow of french from 
the hal and knew that now she 
was about to meet the wom she 
had unconscy hat for the whol 
of her lif 
she could hard believ what she 
act saw 
as the door op alain 
ush in a smal dark

she knew he was right about his

would nev forg her fath 
if she went to the dordogn she 
would be fac a lif that had 
gon on without her a lif 
that had not for one minut tak 
her into consid 
she knew what alain had said about 
her being the lost child but 
ev he did not know how lost 
she had been 
ther was no easy recovery from 
that 
ther was on forget it and 
get on with her pres lif 
her pres lif was glyn and their 
plan for the fut 
it was tru that they wer vagu 
plan but they wer ther all the 
sam 
she felt flust when she 
rememb what alain had said about 
going to ita 
glyn did want her 
he want to marry her 
it was all hap comfort 
just as she wish 
she didnt want pass 
somebody lik alain lemarchand would 
hav the sort of pass that would 
scar any norm wom 
so many express cross his dark 
fac and ev when he was amus 
ther was a sort of hard sens 
about him 
jenn turn fret on her 
pillow 
sens was a word she had 
read lik any oth engl word 
until now it had meant noth at 
all but now she real knew 
what it meant 
she could do without it 
she was comfort with glyn and 
she want noth mor than that 
alain could keep his com to 
himself 
she was to be in bed for thre 
day at the doct insist and 
she nev ev saw alain 
it gav her an incred guil 
feel as if she was a nuis 
and should be away from her and 
not caus so much troubl 
by the end of the second day 
she had it firm fix in her 
head that alain was simply ign 
the fact that she was her 
and as thy was his hous she 
couldnt mak her mind up wheth 
thy was discourt or a gre 
reliev 
she saw a lot of marguerit and 
slow learn to relax in her 
pres 
again thy brought guilt pil in 
on her head becaus she felt 
the begin of a gre lik 
for the wom who had stol her 
fath away

against the pillow real that 
the thought of alain com back 
was a littl worry 
he would start to press her 
again and she didnt real want 
to go to the dordogn at all 
somehow she was afraid that she 
would discov thing she was bet 
not know 
next morn jenn got up anyway 
and she was walk slow round 
the gard when alain pul up 
in front of the hous 
he did not see her at all as

alain was wrong about that 
ther wer no root prep for

sidestep men who wer determin to

jenn bit her lip in 
vex 
she had mad it quit plain that 
she was not about to stay her at 
all but alain had outmanoeuvr 
her with eas 
in the first plac he had been 
in to his off and delay their 
depart until aft lunch 
in the second plac he was behav 
as if thy was a holiday  a 
welcom break from his busy lif 
 and if she want to go 
back it would mean he would go 
back too 
she would feel lik a spoil child 
insist that she want to go 
hom 
she didnt ev know what he 
did to earn so much money 
anyhow 
they wer run through thick 
forest country and tend beg 
to mount in the car 
non of it was com from 
alain 
jenn knew without being told 
that marguerit was find thy 
difficult each mil had ad to 
her own anxy and alain 
moth was feel many anxy 
too 
for jenn it was a barry 
she had nev expect to hav to 
cross thy vent into her 
fath past 
she was afraid afraid of mak 
a fool of herself afraid that 
past bit would sweep ov her 
and mak her behav bad 
she suspect that alain moth 
was anxy for the sam reason 
and jenn could not help glant 
across at her sympathet 
it was brav of thy wom to 
bring a res and hostil strang 
into the plac that had been her 
hom 
jenn could not help feel 
hostil but non of it was 
direct at marguerit 
it was all cent on a man 
who was now dead a man who 
had cast her asid long ago 
any dreg of leftov res wer 
direct at alain lemarchand the 
man who had forc her into 
thy the man who had forc 
both of them into it 
she was determin that marguerit 
would not suff for it and 
she clamp down on her grow 
fear 
whatev await her at the end of 
thy journey she would fac 
she had fac wors aft 
all 
she look up and found alain 
ey on her the dark gaz 
study her through the driv 
mir 
she had been plac in the back 
for comfort or so he said 
but jenn had not been fool 
alain had not allow her to be 
wher he would hav to talk to 
her 
his on remark had been address 
to his moth who sat besid 
him 
he had said noth to jenn 
exceiv his rec com that they 
wer almost ther 
now he was study her wait 
for react wait for a 
scen 
wel ther would not be 
one 
she look abrupt away and turn 
her ey to the smal vil they 
sped through pretty plac with 
interestinglook shop 
wel away from the motorway now 
each new plac quick gav way to 
furth forest and just as jenn 
was begin to be lul into a 
strang peac by the dappl sunlight 
of the plac the sooth gre 
of nat the car turn on 
to a narrow road and beg to 
climb steady 
she didnt hav to be told 
that they would be ar within 
second marguerit tight should 
told her that and alain lip 
tight too as the tend in 
the car reach him 
he shot a thre look at 
jenn but she was now too 
worry to be annoy 
it was her now the plac 
wher russel bry had liv happy

it was imposs to refus to 
mov though and jenn found

jenn 
whatev marguerit had been about to 
say she did not continu and lat 
chang the subject with firm 
that told jenn she would not bring 
it up again 
ther was a thread of affect 
grow between them and she knew 
that as wel as jenn did 
app she was not prep to 
risk thy for the sak of plead 
russel caus 
jenn was glad 
the ghost wer very clos to the 
surfac her in the dordogn 
her in thy hous and jenn 
was torn in many way 
ther was the mem of past 
hurt  gre hurt and 
ang 
ther was also thy feel that 
any attempt to search into her 
fath past would be disloy to 
her moth 
thing wer best left alon 
ther was also alain who fil 
her thought for most of the 
tim 
aft din they talk about lot 
of thing each car skirt 
the thing uppermost in their mind 
marguerit told jenn that perhap 
fin alain would marry claudin 
at any rat she ad with 
amus he would if it was 
left to claudin 
jenn found that she didnt 
want to know in fact she 
didnt want to know to an 
almost frant ext 
one mor night her and they would 
all go back to par and she 
would go hom to england 
it would be the end of her 
tim being in any way clos to 
alain 
when marguerit went to bed 
jenn went too but sleep was 
far from her 
it had been a day of many 
upset 
twic alain had kiss her 
she had fac a certain amount of 
humy again at the hand of 
that wretch mary but the thing 
that stay in her mind was the 
feel of alain arm and the 
tang of his skin 
it was quit ridic and so very 
obvy that he was doing thy for 
many duby reason of his own 
he was not a man to giv way 
easy and he had cle set his 
heart on mak her recogn her 
fath 
it was all for marguerit 
sak 
exceiv for the littl mean about 
claudin his nasty trick of 
kiss her when he knew that 
mary would see them 
everyth he had don that had 
seem at all kind had been part 
of a plan to mak her fac her 
past for his moth sak 
no doubt it would giv marguerit som 
comfort to be abl to be warm 
and friend with russel 
daught but it was too big 
a pric to pay

the word hom just 
didnt seem to ring tru any

for now she was torn between two

it was the chant that she would 
see alain that he would sud 
com with his dark sardon 
smil his caust com and 
his unexpect kiss 
they turn sou thy tim and 
soon jenn was amus and intrigu 
to see hug gaggl of gees in 
field mov about almost as

the gees mak much 
nois marguerit remark

marguerit laugh at her express 
 ma chegrav  
they are wond and so 
expend 
they hav a very distinct tast 
and are not to be wast by

it led marguerit on to the art of 
cook and jenn was cont 
to sit and list to the sooth 
sound of her voic 
now that marguerit was confid with

no doubt she had spok engl with

jenn look at her in 
aston but ther was no

marguerit was test and discard 
fruit and veget with an almost 
fan zeal 
the gre french cook was buy 
in supply and jenn knew not to 
interrupt 
if alain had been intrigu by her 
colo sint he had first seen

and was reward lat by being 
instruct in the cook of som 
of the purchas 
happy ther was no pacircteacut 
de foy gra to alarm 
her and certain no truffl to

noth mor 
whatev alain plan they did

en him to see his moth 
happy back in charg of her own

the old famili tight around 
her heart the trap feel 
and the mem of alain arm

how would she feel with glyn 
was she about to risk the rest 
of her lif for saf 
she was pleas sleepy by bedtim in 
spit of her thought and for ont had 
a dreamless sleep no im of 
her moth to distract and disturb 
her 
now it was alain fac that 
surfac when she let down her 
guard 
her last thought was to wond what 
lif would hav been lik had she 
been her with her fath instead of 
in england with her moth 
she would hav grown up with 
marguerit calm influ around 
her she would hav been mor 
french than engl

it was all so much useless 
spec becaus when everyth was 
tru laid out sens her 
fath had not want her 
next morn jenn inspect the gar 
and determin got out the

in the sunlight she could see that 
it was indee a rath splendid

timid mount it 
the fact that it was a man 
bik didnt troubl her too 
much

kept her feet on the ground she 
felt reason sec at least 
she kept her toe on the ground 
and spent a rath hil tim 
try to get control of it in 
the courtyard her attempt bring 
marguerit out with word of adv

int of mak a fool of 
herself and allow the girl mor 
gossip to tel claudin 
the field in front of the hous was 
reason flat and she set off to 
tackl that 
no doubt she would be doing the 
cyc irrep dam but the 
urg to rid it was too strong 
to be deny

it meant a lot to her now becaus 
she would nev tak anyth away from

want someth someth to be 
abl to look at someth to

aft all 
her mem of him wer very faint 
and she need someth concret to

thought wel suit 
they had noth in common at all 
glyn was steady and rath stuffy 
she was wild al and sing 
insid restless want someth she 
could nev hav 
school was not the sam eith 
becaus jenn found it hard to keep 
her mind from wing back to

sometim she cam back to the

she had nev ev ask if ther 
was a photograph of her fath 
and she suppos they had been so 
car not to upset her that they 
had nev off one 
she must go back to the 
dordogn back to marguerit 
insid she knew she would also be 
search for alain but she thrust
