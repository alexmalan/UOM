what is archaeolog 
the mean of archaeolog 
when peopl think of archaeolog 
they tend to think of excav 
particul thos in dist land such 
as egypt and greec 
they might think of glasscas 
collect of curio but they 
rar think about the old hous 
next door the ridg and 
mound in the field down the 
road or the bit of old 
pottery that they dig up in the 
gard 
yet archaeolog includ all of 
thes 
archaeolog is oft consid as a 
branch of hist and to som 
ext thy is tru 
hist is the study of the past 
us docu and inscrib as 
evid and hist hav record 
and interpret ev from the 
earliest day of writ up to the 
pres day 
archaeolog on the oth hand 
is the study of the past us 
object and oth excav evid as 
the main sourc of dat 
thy allow the study of peopl 
without any form of writ as wel 
as of lit civil 
almost anyth can be us to shed 
light on the past the 
found of build can show what 
sort of hous peopl liv in 
the remain of tool show how they 
work anim bon and plant 
remain show what they ate and 
pol snail shel and the 
remain of tre and plant can 
ind the typ of clim and 
veget at the tim 
what archaeolog cannot do is tel 
us the nam of the peopl and 
what gre deed they did how 
they influ each oth and what 
they thought and believ in 
 thes are thing that on 
hist evid can tel us

archaeolog and hist study the

use  the last few thousand 
year  examin diff typ of 
evid although they overlap at 
many point 
for exampl a hist wil be 
interest in find out what is 
writ on a sheet of mediev 
vell wherea an archaeolog wil 
want to know what anim skin was 
us how the vell was mad 
and what pig wer us for

for the mas of hum 
ex theref on 
archaeolog evid can giv clu

becaus archaeolog us many typ of 
mat remain as evid 
suppl them with hist evid 
wherev poss the subject of 
archaeolog overlap just about every 
oth academ disciplin 
for exampl archaeolog collab with 
petrolog in study the rock from

furtherm the many branch of 
archaeolog are widerang includ

archaeolog doe not just deal with 
bury evid but also with 
sit and object of all kind 
the study of build is consid 
eq import 
indust archaeolog for exampl 
involv the investig survey 
record and preserv of old 
indust build and also of 
all assocy equip and machinery 
of all kind 
in an age wher many peopl 
spec in their work liv 
it is the round allembrac 
nat of archaeolog that mak it 
such a fascin and popul 
pursuit

one of the few exceiv to thy

to hav been regard as extrem 
old and to hav excit the 
about how the lintel wer rais 
one ear the was that the 
mag merlin plac the ston 
thy lack of curios about the 
past was prob larg caus by 
the fact that the bibl was 
acceiv as a complet account of 
the begin of the world and its 
ear hist a view that was 
not sery challeng until the lat

bef the th century virt 
the on peopl concern with the

archaeolog is us regard as 
hav its begin in the mid

topograph such as john leland 
 who was employ

although his work was not

foreshadow the work of lat 
topograph such as william camd 
 
by the end of the century 
ther was a grow feel that 
find and monu belong to a 
past that ought to be record 
and around  william camd wrot 
his book brittan  
the origin vers was in latin

the thcentury interest in ant

by the end of the th

begin to chang from fieldwork to 
excav 
many peopl wer no long cont to 
record ant monu they want 
to know mor about them and in 
particul they want object for 
their priv museum 
to meet thes need most 
excav wer cont on bur 
mound as thes off the 
best chant of recov complet 
object worthy of display in the 
ear and mid th century the 
recovery of object was the prim 
reason for excav 
thy situ on start to 
chang in the lat th century 
as mor excav try to 
understand what they wer find 
excav such as thos of the germ 
excav heinrich schlieman

pion of the techn of 
archaeolog excav 
the way forward was shown by 
gen pit  
aft a car in the brit 
army dur which tim he had 
don a gre deal of fieldwork and 
excav and had amass a 
collect of artefact from all ov 
the world he spent the rest 
of his lif study and 
excav archaeolog sit on his

he conduc research into how artefact 
grad develop ov a period of 
tim the study of which is 
known as typolog 
he also carry out archaeolog 
expery and was the first 
inspect of ant monu in gre 
britain appoint in  
it was pit method of 
excav though that wer 
his most import contribut to 
archaeolog 
he laid the found of modern 
excav pract lay emphas 
on the import of control 
dissect of sit to gath 
inform rath than undisciplin 
dig to uncov bury build

pit was wel aw that 
excav destroy evid as it 
uncov it and so he kept 
metic record 
furtherm he publ the result 
of his excav ful in the 
four volum of excav in 
cranborn chas  which hav been 
a model for subsequ excav 
report 
the principl of excav that

he gre influ modern method of

pit method and mod them 
to his own idea 
in  he publ 
archaeolog from the ear  
an instruct book on field 
archaeolog many modern excav 
techn hav their origin in the 
principl that wheel set out in 
that book 
he was one of the pion in 
op up archaeolog to everyon 
both through his book and through 
radio and televid appear 
the import of landscap survey as 
the prim sourc of archaeolog 
evid was eclips by excav at 
the end of the th century 
and nev ful recov 
but the use of aircraft in the 
first world war show the pot 
of aer reconnaiss for discov

the divid lin between archaeolog 
and treas hunt was all but 
invis 
such was the gen level of 
knowledg that it was easy 
poss for a treas hunt to 
know mor about the subject than 
someon claim to be an 
archaeolog 
today the gap between treas 
hunt and archaeolog is 
consid and ther is littl 
poss of confus the two 
the main aim of the treas hunt 
is to mak a fin gain from 
what is found wherea the main 
aim of the archaeolog is to 
investig the past 
the thre main typ of peopl who 
pract archaeolog are profess

why do archaeolog 
in an age wher commerc profit 
and gain are predomin the 
purpos of archaeolog is oft cal 
into quest 
the main reason for pursu 
archaeolog is of cours to find 
out as much as poss about how 
rec and remot socy liv 
and op 
thy desir to discov can tak 
sev diff form depend on a 
person rang of knowledg 
for most peopl though ther is a 
curios about the past about 
how peopl liv and behav 
about wheth they hav chang ov 
the century and thy can in part 
be answ by archaeolog 
the good preserv of body 
eith delib mum or 
accid as with body 
preserv in peat bog 
oft giv a good ide of what 
peopl act look lik in 
prevy tim 
the remain of hous and possess 
giv an ide of peopl 
lifestyl whil the remain of 
their tool can show what work they 
did and to som ext how 
hard they would hav had to work 
to do a particul job 
left through archaeolog it 
poss to find out many detail 
about ant settl so that 
hous and the gen landscap can 
be reconstruct fair acc 
thy is a reconstruct of an iron 
age farm at buts england 
environ evid can also giv 
widerang inform on past environ 
and clim 
quest concern landscap feat and 
ant monu  what they 
are how old they are who 
mad them and so on  can in 
part be answ by archaeolog 
evid and in the cas 
of preh monu it is the 
on mean avail of deduc such 
inform 
abov top the spectacul st 
century ad rom the at jerash 
in jord is a popul tour 
attract 
thy interest in what is oft 
term cult herit 
also involv oth study such as 
loc hist heraldry and 
genealog but archaeolog has an 
act rol to play in provid 
a coh pict of our herit 
many misconceiv about the past hav 
already been correct and in all 
lik many mor wil on be 
put right through continu archaeolog 
research 
for exampl it is stil commonplac 
in cartoon to show cavem and 
dinosa togeth despit the fact 
that it has been known for many 
year that dinosa wer extinct 
long bef the evolv of 
cavem 
simil ear hum are alway 
portray as hunt surv 
larg on a diet of meat and 
thy interpret is stil being 
taught to schoolchildr 
howev cur research show that 
ear hum did not gen rely 
on a meat diet but that plant 
food wer at least as import 
far from being mighty hunt 
ear hum are mor lik to 
hav been opportun scaveng 
part of the misconceiv aros becaus 
the bon of ear hum hav 
oft been found with bon of 
oth anim and it was 
simpl assum that thy show 
that they had kil and eat 
oth anim and had lat died 
amid the remain of prevy meal 
rec research has shown that 
in such cas it is mor lik 
that the anim and hum had 
been eat by oth pred such 
as leopard an hyena 
in many country one pract 
offshoot of the grow of interest 
in the herit is the grow of 
tour 
most tour sight are sit of 
hist or archaeolog import 
and archaeolog has an expand rol 
in the pres of such 
attract 
hist sit and ant monu 
that are bad pres provid 
littl or no expl seldom 
achiev popul as tour sit 
unless they are un and already

stoneheng in wiltshir 
consequ many sit hav benefit 
from archaeolog research and in 
som cas excav in ord to 
be prop pres to the 
visit 
in the modern indust world 
mor and mor peopl are feel a 
need to find out about their 
immedy and dist past and 
thy is lik to increas in the

thy enh the mor duty for 
archaeolog to rescu as much

past bef it is destroy 
fut gen are lik to depl 
the way cur socy are allow 
so much of their herit to be 
destroy without record 
a socy that ign its past 
deserv to hav no fut 
perhap the most import and least 
obvy reason for doing archaeolog is 
that in many way the 
past is the key to the 
pres and to the fut 
archaeolog help us to understand 
the past and thy understand 
help a gre deal in the understand 
of socy today and the develop 
of socy in the fut 
an expl who doe not compil 
map as he or she process is 
lik to end up going round in 
circ likew a socy 
that doe not know wher it 
has com from in the past has 
no chant of know wher it is 
going in the fut 
in thy way archaeolog is cent 
to all knowledg which is why 
it ap to so many diff 
peopl 
archaeolog has quit lit

how archaeolog sit becom bury 
whil som archaeolog sit such as 
the spectacul ruin at petr in 
jord or the monolith statu on 
east island in the pac hav 
nev been complet bury the 
mas of archaeolog sit and 
find hav to be unearth 
how sit and find com to be 
bury depend on a numb of 
fact and ther is oft mor 
than one reason why they are now 
benea the ground 
the most simpl reason for someth 
being bury is that peopl hav 
bury it and domest wast is 
prob the most common exampl of 
delib bur 
on archaeolog sit pit are 
frequ found that wer us for 
the dispos of household refus 
that would nowaday be put in a 
dustbin collect by the municip 
auth and tak to a 
commun rub tip 
rub tip nowaday oft consist 
of larg hol in the ground such 
as disus quarry which are 
being fil in and which are 
gig vers of the rub pit 
found on archaeolog sit 
when rub pit are excav 
sherd of pottery and frag of 
bon are frequ the on vis 
remain becaus much of the 
refus put into pit was the 
remn of food prep which hav 
sint decay 
howev microscop analys of the 
soil in a pit can sometim show 
what sort of food remain wer 
origin bury 
below the templ of

bur of hum and anim 
corps and crem are 
anoth inst of delib bur 
in many cult vary object 
term grav good wer common 
deposit with hum bur 
thes grav good could includ one 
or mor pot or contain 
weapon toolsand jewellery 
in som cas thes may repres 
the person belong of the dead 
person but many of the grav 
good such as food and coin 
seem to hav been bury for the 
benefit of the dead person in 
the afterl 
som bur lik thos of the 
rul of ant egypt hav many 
grav good 
left much archaeolog 
evid has been delib bury 
such as thy skeleton 
body which wer bury with their 
leg bent in thy way are 
term crouch inhum 
the draughtsperson is record the 
prec detail and posit of the 
bon bef they are excav 
anoth common form of delib bur 
is that of a hoard of object 
such as coin scrap met or 
jewellery 
bef bank or ev lock and 
key wer inv the us way 
of protect valu object and money 
was to hid them from oth 
peopl 
oft such valu wer hid in

if they wer not retriev such 
hoard remain hid until accid 
found oft hundr or ev 
thousand of year lat 
not all hoard wer meant to be 
recov som wer delib bury 
as religy off and sacr 
it can be very difficult to 
be sur of why a hoard of 
object was bury in the ground 
right the collaps level 
and rebuild of mud brick hous 
has led to the form of hug 
mound in som part of the 
world 
in the near east they are known 
as tel such as thy one 
being excav at tel akko 
acr in israel 
nat catastroph such as volc 
erupt may result in sit 
being bury very rapid 
the most fam exampl is the 
bur of the rom town of 
pompei and herculane in ita

oth sit hav also been discov 
bury in ash and lav from

the bur of sit by volc

that such sit are lik very 
wellpreserv tim caps 
oth nat phenomen also can bury 
a sit includ sandstorm and

in town and city which are

ther is a continu process of 
old build being demol and

thy process of demolit and

it can be difficult to apprecy 
the amount by which the ground

in the near east the const 
rebuild of mud brick hous has 
result in the form of 
consid mound known as tel 
the one at jericho is ov

megiddo in israel loom abov the 
landscap show the siz of tel 
that form in the near east 
through continu habit of the 
sit 
below ston wal wer oft 
us as field bound but 
when they are no long maintain 
and collaps they can quick 
becom overgrown with veget and 
hid from view 
the most common but least 
obvy way that sit get bury 
is through the nat process of 
decay and renew 
when a masonry build is abandon 
and is no long repair damp 
within the build enco insect 
and fung to attack the timb 
whil wind rain and chang 
of temp attack the extery of 
the build 
ont a breach is mad in the 
fabr of the roof  when 
thatch rot or slat or til 
slip  rain get in and 
the process of decay accel until 
the roof collaps 
intern wal and flo collaps and 
the decay remain of their 
timb becom mix with dust 
leav and oth debr blown into 
the build to form a soil in 
which plant and ev tre wil 
grow 
the masonry shel of the build 
form a trap for mor windblown 
leav dust and seed form 
a deep soil whil the 
weath insect and plant attack 
the remain wal from both 
sid 
grad the wal collaps a 
process oft accel by the 
penet of plant and tre root 
between the ston 
sometim wal are delib demol 
so that the ston can be reus 
elsewh 
ev the cyc of decay 
timb mort and plant follow 
by renew plant grow reduc the 
sit of the build to a low 
mound 
ev without demolit of wal 
it may tak on  year 
for a masonry build to disappear 
benea the ground but less 
subst build can disappear ev 
fast 
timb build may simply rot and 
collaps and oth feat such as 
pit and ditch wil silt up very 
rapid ont they ceas to be 
maintain 
right thy build was ont 
a smal ston cot but its 
decay and collaps has been accel 
by tre and oth veget which 
hav found the old build an 
id environ 
below as a ston or 
brick build collaps the 
build debr fal eith sid of 
the collaps wal so that the 
sit becom a heap of rubbl 
unrecogn until it is excav 
howev bur process can be 
quit complex 
for exampl a rom bur alongsid 
a road lead from a rom town 
may origin hav been delib 
bury but as the town 
expand and the bur was 
forgot a hous might be built 
ov the sit 
in tim the hous might 
decay the town disappear and 
the whol sit becom a field 
grow crop 
it is thy sort of sequ of 
ev that archaeolog attempt to 
unravel when try to understand how 
sit and find hav becom 
bury 
how sit are destroy 
archaeolog sit are oft describ 
as a dimin nonrehyrenew 
resourc 
a field of rar flow that is 
destroy can be repl and may 
ev be the sam as the 
field that was destroy ev if 
the process doe tak  
year 
but each archaeolog sit is 
un and ont destroy it 
cannot be replac the inform 
it contain is lost not for 
 year or so but 
forev 
the nat process of decay and 
erod are grad destroy all 
archaeolog sit 
howev such process of decay tak 
thousand or hundr of thousand of 
year wherea the 
main thre are much mor rapid 
and immedy 
thy process is not of concern to 
archaeolog alon the destruct 
of archaeolog sit oft coincid 
with the destruct of wildl 
habit and chang in the 
environ 
below when ev subst 
timb build decay and collaps 
the on evid that is us 
avail for archaeolog to discov 
are nonorg find and hol 
in the ground in which the timb 
post may hav been origin 
plac 
one of the main caus of 
destruct of archaeolog sit is 
the construct of hous 
indust sit and road 
in the past such build work 
has not alway been complet 
destruct but modern techn of 
construct us requir deep 
found tot destroy any 
und sit 
simil the mass mov of 
ear involv in modern road 
construct provid littl chant of 
surv for any archaeolog sit on 
the lin of a new road the 
construct of dam us involv 
earthmov on a vast scal and 
the destruct and drown of 
larg area of the landscap 
abov the destruct of 
larg tract of the landscap for 
modern road build oft involv 
the destruct of archaeolog sit 
min extract by quarry and 
opencast min also disturb sit 
of the vary typ of min 
extract the exploit of riv 
gravel tend to be the most 
devast becaus in the past riv 
gravel hav provid the most 
attract environ for settl 
off fertil soil and an abund 
wat supply 
it is theref us the cas 
that ev mor archaeolog sit are 
destroy on riv gravel than on 
the hil or mountain ground 
wher ston is gen quarry 
right an urb sit being 
excav bef it is destroy by 
the very deep found of modern 
build 
the most widespread and prob the 
most sery destruct of archaeolog 
sit though is caus by 
agricult includ plough 
deforest and afforest and 
drain and cle of margin 
land 
old method of farm on 
caus surfac dam to 
archaeolog sit by plough 
but modern intend farm destroy 
sit much mor quick 
particul harm is the process of 
deep plough which destroy 
far mor of an archaeolog sit 
than the old shallow plough 
moreov the use of larg 
heavy machinery necessit the remov 
of obstac such as bur mound 
and ant field bound to 
improv efficy 
in som country margin land 
that was prevy hea or 
moorland as wel as much past 
land has been rec plough 
for the first tim in century 
with the result destruct of many 
archaeolog sit 
left the construct of 
dam inevit involv the destruct 
and submerg of archaeolog sit 
her a bronz age sit at tel 
halaw in northern syr is being 
excav in adv of floodw 
from a dam being construct on the 
euphr 
one branch of agricult is 
particul destruct of archaeolog 
sit forestry 
the modern method of plant 
tre us involv larg amount of 
bank and ditch of the 
plant ground in ord to provid 
good drain 
any archaeolog sit not destroy 
in thy process are lik to be at 
least as sev dam by the 
root of the tre which are 
us set as clos togeth as is 
econom viabl 
in oth reg widespread destruct 
of marsh and peatbog is tak 
plac through drain for improv 
agricult and for reclam 
purpos and through commerc 
exploit of the peat 
the lay of land drain is 
destruct in itself as is the 
deep plough that oft follow 
it but drain also has a 
direct dram effect on archaeolog 
sit 
waterlog of archaeolog sit 
inhibit bact decay so that org 
mat such as wood leath and 
ev bog body can 
surv for thousand of year  
sometim complet vil and landscap 
are preserv 
ont land is drain thy 
protect is remov from any 
und archaeolog sit and 
org remain begin to decay and 
disintegr extrem rapid 
one exampl is in florid wher 
peat deposit cov  mil 
acr much of which is now 
being system lost through drain 
op hundr of archaeolog 
sit and find hav been destroy 
with virt no record being 
mad 
sit are also being destroy in 
vary country by the plund of 
suit sit for find to sel to 
tour or to supply the illeg 
trad in sal ant 
the result of the widespread destruct 
of archaeolog sit is that most 
excav hav to be conduc on 
sit that are und thre of 
destruct 
in fact most archaeolog sit 
are destroy without any record becaus 
the pac of destruct is too 
gre for the limit resourc 
avail to archaeolog 
nowaday very few excav tak 
plac on sit that do not hav 
som form of thre of dam or 
destruct becaus enough fund are 
not avail to fin a ful 
research excav on every poss 
sit 
abov the prep of land 
for forestry can destroy ev 
wellpreserv archaeolog sit 
particul on land which has on 
been us for past 
the plant grow and 
fel of the tre and the 
use of heavy machinery ad to the 
destruct process 
how sit are discov 
the most obvy way of discov 
archaeolog sit is to go out 
and look for them  but 
thy is not quit as simpl as 
it might seem 
num archaeolog sit are already 
known and hav been record 
although oft not investig in 
any detail so the first task 
is to find out what thes sit 
are 
thy may simply involv consult an 
index of all the sit find 
and monu in the are but 
if such an index doe not 
ex extend research in museum 
and libr may be necess to 
compil such an index bef any 
work in the field tak plac 
in area wher the pop is 
rel smal and thinlyspread 
fieldwork look for new sit may 
wel discov ruin and larg 
monu such as bur mound 
hillfort and rock paint that 
wer prevy unknown 
in many part of the world 
virt no search for sit and 
find has tak plac and the 
pot for discovery is enorm 
for exampl it is thought that in 
zimbabw ther are prob ten of 
thousand of sit of rock art 
but on a tiny fract hav ev 
been record and in israel rec 
survey hav rev thousand of 
prevy unknown sit 
left ev sit 
delib set asid are in dang 
from agricult and forestry as 
the erod of thy bur ground 
by heavy machinery demonst 
in dens pop area the 
chant of find such obvy sit 
that hav been overlook by prevy 
archaeolog are very smal 
in thes pop area fieldwork 
cont instead on look for 
scat of find such as sherd 
of pottery and work ston 
becaus thes giv an ind of 
wher prevy unknown archaeolog sit 
lie bury the find are 
us brought to the surfac as 
the sit are dam by 
plough 
thy process of search for find 
is cal fieldwalk or surfac 
collect and to be most 
effect it is don system 
hav obtain permit to walk 
ov the land a group of 
peopl divid the are between them 
us in the squ of a 
grid mark out in som way on 
the ground and each person 
collect and record any find 
in their particul are 
by plot each spot wher 
find wer collect on a plan 
cont of find wil be 
rev and thes may ind 
the sourc of the find the 
archaeolog sit 
it is necess to look for 
cont of find becaus a 
hand of find could hav got 
onto the land in any numb of 
way and is not necess an 
ind of the pres of a 
nearby archaeolog sit 
for exampl domest wast which 
could includ brok pottery was 
oft spread on field dur 
man  the farm from which 
the pottery cam could be som 
dist away 
in area wher ther are vast 
scat of find lying on the 
surfac it is not pract to 
collect the find but instead the 
posit of the find are acc 
plot 
below the system search 
for new sit and surfac find can 
tak plac ov many diff 
terrain oft to find out mor 
about a landscap bef it is

fieldwalk is her tak plac on 
the mountain of gubbio ita 
left the destruct of 
sit through drain for agricult 
land improv continu to be carry 
out despit the surplus of crop 
produc by many country 
ont a sit is put back into 
produc it may not be 
immedy obvy that the archaeolog 
sit hav been destroy 
archaeolog sit are oft discov 
by accid 
many such sit hav been found 
dur the construct of build 
road railway dam and so 
on as wel as dur min 
extract 
unfortun such discovery is oft 
of limit valu sint by 
the tim the sit is recogn and 
report it is us mor than 
half destroy in most cas 
ther is littl tim for archaeolog 
to salv inform from what is 
left of the sit 
becaus of thy attempt are mad 
in many area to examin land 
destin for construct work or 
min extract bef the work 
start and if poss to 
record and ev excav sit 
thre with destruct 
it is also us to hav an 
archaeolog examin the are whil 
construct work is going on sint 
archaeolog remain are not alway 
easy recogn by thos concern 
with construct 
right sit and find can 
oft be discov dur construct 
work 
all the archaeolog can do on the 
lin of thy new road is to 
hurry record feat and salv 
find 
howev the most efficy and 
produc method of find 
archaeolog sit is through aer 
photograph sint from the air it 
is poss to see sit which are 
difficult to recogn from ground 
level 
walk amongst the ruin of an 
ant city for exampl it is 
imposs to gain an overal impress 
of the layout 
but if a person climb a nearby 
hil and look down on the 
sit the whol city can be 
seen and to som ext 
understood view a sit at 
an angl in thy way is equ 
to an obl aer photograph 
if the person fly immedy 
abov the cent of the city 
the whol city is cle display 
and comprehens 
left through aer 
photograph it is easy to understand 
ev welldocu and vis sit 
thy is a neolith heng monu 
in cumbr england 
the earthwork are cle vis 
and the sit can be seen to 
hav been part destroy by the 
modern road 
when look for new sit on the 
ground it can be very easy to 
overlook feat or fail to understand 
them wherea sit view from 
the air can be seen in their 
entir 
right the sit of an 
iron age broch in scotland seen 
from the ground 

below the sam sit from the 
air and a much cle pict 
emerg 
obl aer photograph are easy to 
tak than vert on but are 
difficult to use afterward as 
ther is distort of the im 
vert aer photograph tak from 
direct abov a sit are us 
main for plot feat on to 
map as they show less distort 
nowaday most map are mad by 
plot feat from vert aer 
photograph us comput to correct 
the distort in the photograph 
abov in field of grow 
crop and on parch grassland it 
is poss to detect archaeolog 
sit by cropmark such as thy smal 
rectilinear enclos 
aer photograph is particul valu 
in detect bury archaeolog 
sit pick up thre main 
clu vis from the air 
mark in grow crop 
mark in the soil and 
shadow on the ground 
left the use of aer 
photograph in understand 
cropmark at the top the 
cropmark seen from ground level 
in the cent the cropmark are 
view as if in an obl aer 
photograph and below the sam 
cropmark are seen as if in a 
vert aer photograph 
crop mark sit are main 
caus by diff in the amount 
of moist in the soil 
if a rom road is bury in a 
field ther wil be a gre 
dep of topsoil and theref 
mor moist on eith sid of 
the road than on top of it and 
so crop wil be stunt and 
wil rip ear abov the road 
than on eith sid 
thy diff in the crop can be 
seen from the air although 
unfortun not all crop respond to 
diff in moist in such a 
vis way 
thos that do may on display the 
diff for a mat of week 
or ev day bef the whol crop 
rip so ther is an el 
of luck in fly ov the right 
plac at the right tim 
the use of infr photograph 
is particul us in thy 
respect 
although infr light is invis to 
the hum eye it can be 
detect by spec photograph film 
in gen the amount of infr 
light reflect from a plant depend 
on its rip so that infr 
photograph can produc goodrehycontrast 
im of crop mark that may be 
hard vis on ordin photograph

soil mark sit are vis becaus 
of diff colo mark in the

exampl if a bur mound with 
a ditch around it has been 
flat by plough the mat 
from which the mound was 
construct the soil fil the 
ditch and the soil in the 
rest of the plough field may be 
of diff colo 
thy is easiest to detect when the 
mound has been mad of a mat 
with a distinct colo such as 
chalk 
shadow sit are mad vis by 
earthwork or ston wal cast 
shadow in very lowlevel sunlight 
at dawn or bef sunset or 
mor us in wint when the

ev very low earthwork or wal 
cast shadow thu betray the 
pres of an archaeolog sit 
but whil many sit can be found 
by us aer photograph many 
cannot such as thos bury by 
a consid dep of alluv and

oth caus 
whatev the method us to discov 
a new sit the most import 
el is to record its posit 
and any oth detail that might be 
app at the tim of discovery 
not on is thy import in ord 
to be abl to find the sit 
again and to mak oth aw of

many archaeolog sit are on known 
from old aer photograph tak dur

right low earthwork or ston 
wal can be discov from the

vary method of loc sit 
hav theref been develop which 
attempt to giv a bet ide of 
a sit layout 
the two main method us are 
resist survey and magnet 
survey 
resist survey is bas on 
the principl that underground feat such 
as masonry wal hav a high 
resist to an elect cur 
wherea filledin feat such as 
ditch or pit hav a low 
resist 
us for thy typ of survey 
are resist met op by 
pass an elect cur between 
met prob push into the 
ground and meas the resist 
in the ground to that cur 
by us a grid mark out on 
the ground each point wher a 
read is tak can be plot 
the result of the survey can be 
pres in a vary of way 
such as by conto 
show lin of eq read in 
the sam way that weath map 
use conto to show lin of 
eq press 
mor common dotdens diagram are 
us in which dot clos togeth 
giv a dark im portray 
high read whil dot spac 
furth apart giv a light 
im portray low read 
nowaday the result of near all 
such survey are plot by 
comput which off a wid rang 
of diagram method to portray the 
result 
with comput plot the sam 
survey read can be plot in a 
vary of way to extract the 
maxim amount of inform from 
them 
dotdens diagram are stil the most 
common method of portray result 
becaus feat such as wal which 
giv high read show up as 
dark lin 
dotdens diagram are theref simil 
in appear to ordin plan and 
so are easy to understand 
abov vary typ of bury 
feat and find are detect in 
diff way by magnet survey 
abov and by resist 
survey below 
o is an av background 
read  a neg respons 
and  a posit respons 
the diff method do not react 
to the sam typ of bury 
feat and are thu to som 
ext compl 
the oth main method of loc 
sit is by magnet survey 
thy work by detect diff 
in the magnet field of the soil 
us a magnetomet 
thes diff are caus by sev 
fact 
solid feat such as wal tend to 
hav a smal amount of magnet 
min within them than the 
surround soil and theref giv 
low read 
area of burn such as 
hearth giv high read as 
do filledin feat such as pit 
and ditch 
as with resist met read 
are tak at point on a grid 
mark out on the ground and 
the result are us plot in 
the form of computerdrawn diagram 
many resist met and magnetomet 
can now be fit with a dat 
record which record the read 
in computerread form so that the 
result can be fed direct into a 
comput as soon as the survey is 
fin 
oth techn such as echosound 
and soil scan rad are 
cur being develop and are 
lik to be us mor and mor 
in the fut for acc loc 
and survey of sit 
oth less scy method of 
loc are also in use 
thes includ prob aug and 
dows 
prob simply involv push a met 
rod into the soil to try to 
determin the pres of bury 
feat from the dep of penet 
of the prob 
an aug work in much the sam 
way but instead of being push 
into the soil it has a 
corkscrew end which can be twist 
down into the ear 
mor common are hollow aug and 
bor which are us to collect 
sampl of soil and mor 
oft peat for environ 
analys 
abov a resist met 
being us to survey a sit 
right a try trench being 
dug by hand 
dows is the sam proc as 
wat divin 
the dows us som kind of 
ind such as a twig met 
rod or a pendul to 
show the pres or abs of 
archaeolog feat as the dows 
walk ov the ground 
although the mech by which 
dows work is not understood 
the method has been shown to be 
cap of acc loc bury 
archaeolog feat 
with all thre method outlin 
abov the best result are 
obtain by conduc a system 
survey us on a markedout 
grid so that the result can be 
plot as a plan of the sit 
non of the cur method of 
loc sit is tot acc 
howev 
the most common fault is that 
import feat are not alway 
rev by thes method which 
can lead to the excav being 
sit wrong 
as the on certain way to 
loc bury feat is to excav 
them try trench are oft dug 
to confirm the result of a survey 
bef the main excav tak 
plac 
sometim try trench is the 
prim method us for loc 
eith becaus the resourc for a 
resist or magnet survey are not 
avail or becaus they would be 
inappropry 
the problem with try trench is 
that if they are very smal it 
is easy to miss the main feat 
of a sit yet the larg the 
trench us the near the 
process becom to fullsc 
excav 
trench can be dug by machin 
although it is difficult to recogn 
archaeolog feat as a machin is 
uncov and perhap cut through 
them 
for thy reason machinecut try 
trench are most common us on 
sit wher ther is insufficy 
tim for mor car method 
whenev poss try trench are 
dug by hand becaus thes alway 
provid mor inform than machinedug 
trench of the sam siz 
abov her a try trench 
has est the pres of 
ear christ grav in bang 
wal 
such try trench are far mor 
costeffect than undertak a fullsc 
excav without being sur if 
archaeolog feat surv on a 
sit 
 
dig it up and writ it down 
excav 
excav the unearth 
examin and record of 
archaeolog sit is most 
peopl ide of archaeolog 
despit the fact that in many 
country far mor valu work is 
don by acc loc and 
plot unknown sit rath than 
by excav 
very timeconsum labo intend 
and an expend part of 
archaeolog the very process of 
excav also destroy the sit 
complet excav is complet 
destruct and so excav is 
oft describ as an unrep 
expery 
no two sit are exact alik 
and so the excav of a sit 
such as a bur mound cannot be 
duply by excav anoth bur 
mound 
for thy reason archaeolog bear 
a heavy respons to mak 
comprehend record of everyth that 
they find and observ becaus no 
one els wil ev hav anoth 
chant to do so 
excav is best thought of as 
a postmortem examin of an 
archaeolog sit and involv a 
detail dissect of a sit in ord 
to gain as much inform as 
poss 
ther are thre kind of 
excav research rescu and 
salv 
research excav are conduc prim 
to test hypothes and to answ 
quest that hav ar out of 
archaeolog research 
rescu excav are thos 
conduc on sit that are 
thre with destruct and should 
be carry out to at least the sam 
standard as found on research 
excav 
salv excav are thos carry 
out on sit wher destruct has 
already begun oft becaus the 
sit was unknown bef construct 
work start 
in thy situ it is very 
difficult to maintain high standard 
as such work us has to be 
don within a short tim limit 
and oft with very littl spac 
und such condit any inform 
about the sit that can be salv 
is regard as a bon 
unfortun in som situ ther 
is insufficy tim to j complet 
a rescu excav and the work 
may i hav to be continu as 
a salv op 
right a derelict mediev 
barn pry to convert to hous 
unit 
when sit such as thy are to 
be destroy it is import that 
the build abov the ground is 
record bef it is destroy as wel 
as the ground benea being 
excav 
below record the chang 
plan of a sit is one of the 
key task dur an excav 
one way of look at a sit 
is to examin its stratigraph  
the sequ of lay that hav 
been laid down one on top of 
anoth to form the sit itself 
thy is don by leav vert 
fac cal sect as 
the excav process so that the 
lay vis in thos sect can 
be record and study 
anoth way of look at a sit 
is to cont on its plan 
and to see how thy chang with 
tim 
for exampl ther may be evid 
for a sequ of build being 
construct and going out of use ov 
a long period of tim 
to study thy chang pattern 
larg area of the sit are us 
excav simult so that the plan 
of build and oth struct can 
be bet understood 
abov an excav at the 
bronz age tel on lak alassad 
in nor syr 
a system of mediums trench is 
being us 
id an archaeolog want to 
obtain as much inform as 
poss about both the stratigraph of 
a sit and its plan but ther 
is a conflict between the two 
approach 
if for exampl the sit is 
excav in a sery of smal 
trench in ord to gain the maxim 
amount of inform about the 
stratigraph it is then very 
difficult to understand the plan view 
of the sit 
on the oth hand excav of 
a larg op are leav very 
few if any sect that 
show the complet stratigraph of the 
sit 
one solut to thy problem us 
by mortim wheel is to excav 
a sit in a sery of mediums

in pract sint each sit is 
un archaeolog use the mixt 
of largesc are excav and 
sect that seem most appropry to

on most excav the first 
op is to remov the modern 
deposit cov the archaeolog 
level 
thy overburd may be on a 
shallow lay of topsoil or a deep 
lay of modern build rubbl as 
is the cas on som urb 
sit and it may be remov

can be distinct 
on sit wher ther are no

thos diff alon show the

in 
ont such diff in the soil 
can be detect the archaeolog 
feat are excav oft by 
first remov what appear to be 
the latest uppermost lay 
and then process to the next 
lay and so on 
the way the dig is don depend 
on the nat of the sit 
all kind of hand tool rang 
from pick mattock and shovel 
down to build point trowel

are us 
sampl of the soil and in 
som cas all the excav soil 
may be kept for dry siev or 
wet siev in ord to retriev

the exact man in which the 
excav process can vary consid 
depend on the sit charact 
and ther are us sev poss 
strategy that can be follow in 
any particul situ 
for every sit howev the 
archaeolog main concern are to

for the clim and loc environ 
when the sit was occupy and 
the rel of the sit to

and furth afield 
with all of thes fact in 
mind the archaeolog work out 
the excav strategy as the 
excav process to build as 
complet a pict of the sit as 
poss 
apart from phys dig a sit

import 
whil the sequ of excav

it is a vit part of the 
writ record that the exact plac 
wher every find was discov is 
not particul import becaus 
find can yield a gre deal of

for exampl it is ess to 
know exact wher each find was

when the excav is ov all 
that is left is the record

problem and limit of excav 
one of the main problem of 
archaeolog excav is cop with 
the weath 
apart from the discomfort of rain 
cold wind or excess heat 
the amount of moist in the soil 
affect the vis of the lay 
that are being excav 
if the soil is too wet 
on the most obvy feat are 
lik to be cle vis whil 
if the soil is too dry no 
diff in soil colo and text 
may be distinct at all 
so in almost any weath 
condit ther is a gre 
dang of not being abl to see 
and record soil lay prop 
below mak a detail scal 
draw of a vert sect can 
tak as long as excav the feat 
in the first plac 
in country wher too much moist

wat for moist the sit is 
gen scarc in such area 
as a gen rul though 
it is easy to cop with a 
dry sit than a wet one as long 
as a wat supply is avail 
a dry sit can be moist to 
highlight the diff in soil colo

right aer view of an 
excav can also be obtain by 
suspend a camer from a kit 
apart from thes ther are also 
underw sit and land sit 
which are act waterlog 
thes rar hav anyth approach 
the vary of colo of soil that 
norm occ on dry land sit 
and excav hav to rely much 
mor on the diff text in 
the mat being excav 
it is poss to protect the 
excav from inc weath 
condit such as by the use of 
shelt but the sit themselv 
cannot be dry out as the 
waterlog act preserv the

anoth mas limit fact in

the excav process 
as each excav remov a lay

whil the excav was in

to wash som of the find and 
mark each one with a cod

thy task has to be complet 
bef any furth work can be 
don 
the quant of find depend on 
the typ of sit being excav 
and for sit that produc a larg 
quant of find the task of 
wash and mark them can be 
lengthy 
an excav of a rom vill for 
exampl can produc sev ton

glass and til 
below in country wher 
rain is lik to be a 
problem shelt can be erect 
und which excav can tak plac 
in all weath 
the wash and mark find are 
then sort into group such as sherd 
of coars pottery sherd of glaz

wet country larg purposebuilt 
shelt erect ov the excav 
are an invalu mean of allow 
the excav to continu 
allyearround and to allow 
visit to view the excav 
such shelt are rar us 
though becaus of their expens 
ont thy is don the 
archaeolog start to deal with the 
record of the excav 
apart from the find thes repres 
all that is left of the 
excav sit and so are 
extrem import they also repres 
the invest in the excav from 
a fin point of view which 
may hav cost a consid amount 
of money and it is theref 
us to duply them stor 
one copy far away from the origin 
record in cas of accid 
thy is easy enough with record 
sheet and draw which can 
simply be photocop or put on to 
microfilm but is far mor of 
a problem with a photograph record 
compr hundr or thousand of

of the excav high standard 
of record and excav should 
alway be maintain 
in the foreground part of an ov 
is being excav whil behind a 
draughtsperson is doing a scal plan 
of part of the sit 
the first stag in analys the 
record is to scrutin each individ 
record to ens that it is in 
ord ful complet and that 
any not er are correct 
wher poss 
the detail catalog of photograph 
should be crossref to the 
writ record at thy stag so 
that the photograph can be us to 
the ful in the postexcav 
analys 
the next task is to est the 
rel between all the lay on 
the sit 
each lay or part of a lay 
is us cal a 
context and each is 
giv a un ident numb 
dur the excav 
sep record are mad for each 
context and any find are 
giv the sam un numb 
on most sit the rel 
between context is drawn as a 
matrix diagram which is rath 
lik a famy tre 
us thy diagram it is poss 
to see at a glant the rel 
of one context to the rest of 
the sit 
compil such a matrix diagram requir 
a detail study of all the 
record howev and inevit 
ther wil be som gap in the 
diagram wher it was not poss 
to est the prec rel 
between som context dur the 
excav itself 
below waterlog sit are 
much mor difficult to excav 
but the amount of mat that 
surv can be remark 
thes repres som of the thousand 
of frag of wood from flag 
fen england 
the matrix diagram also provid a 
bas framework for work out the 
phas of the sit 
for exampl it may be poss to 
determin that one group of context 
repres a build which 
was cov by a group of context 
repres a pav are which in 
turn was cov by a group of 
context repres anoth build 
etc 
a sequ of ev  or 
phas  can be est 
a phas when the first build 
was in use a phas when 
the pav are was in use and 
a phas when the second build 
was in use 
what is mor difficult to est 
is wheth the first build was 
inhabit for a whil demol 
just aft the inhabit mov 
out immedy pav ov 
and a new build lat 
construct or wheth the first 
build was inhabit for a whil 
abandon by its inhabit for many 
year then collaps through 
decay was pav ov lat 
on and then a second build 
construct 
if the record are study sufficy 
wel such evid may becom 
app and the first glimps of 
the sit hist begin to 
emerg 
ont thy has been don the 
inform on each phas of the 
sit can be amalgam with the 
inform from the spec 
report on the find if thes 
hav been fin and with any 
inform from oth sourc such as 
radiocarbon dat 
the spec report us 
includ inform about the dat of 
find and oth sign point such 
as evid for trad or contact 
with oth contemp sit 
archaeolog hav to judg the 
import of the inform in each 
cas and how it rel to 
the analys 
for exampl if pottery from a pit 
is said to be of a particul 
dat by the spec a 
decid has to be tak as to 
how if at all that dat 
rel to the pit in which the 
pottery was found 
it may in fact dat the

be of diff qual som 
may be acc to a few year 
oth on to the nearest coupl

nevertheless the skeleton struct 
form by the rel between the

giv the outlin of the hist of 
the sit as far as it can be 
known 
right it is ess that 
excav find are wash cle

them with waterproof ink 
all thy dat is then writ up 
as a techn report and 
form part of the inform 
stor as an arch for fut

thy detail arch report attempt to 
explain what each group of context 
repres  build 
struct rub deposit and so 
on  and is us as the 
bas for writ a mor cont 
report for publ 
thy publ report aim to provid 
a bas sum of the inform 
about the excav sit for use by 
oth archaeolog 
the amount of detail includ in 
such a report vary consid 
but it is alway a much condens 
vers of the inform contain 
in the arch which would be 
far too cost to publ in its

when prep it the archaeolog 
not on has to consid the 
text but also what illust 
to includ 
map and plan show sit inform 
are near alway includ but the 
numb and typ of photograph and 
of illust of oth detail of 
the sit and of find vary from 
sit to sit 
anybody who need to study a sit 
in detail should look at the 
arch as wel as the publ report 
ont the report is ready for 
publ the archaeolog may then 
writ a book or booklet on the 
excav in term that the gen 
read can understand 
a gre deal of jargon and many 
techn term are us by 
archaeolog and they can mak 
excav report fair 
incomprehens 
such jargon doe contribut 
howev as archaeolog deal with 
many sit object and ev 
trib and nat whos act nam

without a mor gen expl 
the inform gain from the

otherw inform is filt through

someon writ a school textbook 
year aft the excav took

the main diff between spec

abov left petrolog

a thin slic sect of a

a microscop slid such as thy 
vary kind of bas chem analys 
can be us on ceram object such 
as pottery brick and til 
and on met object 
chem analys is us employ 
to determin the mat from which 
an object is mad and oft 
to ident trac el which may 
giv a clu to the origin and

with som pottery chem analys 
can also be us to discov what

object 
by determin the composit of the

cam from 
thy method of examin involv 
cut a very thin slic from the 
object which is fix to a 
microscop slid and ground down 
until it is on mm thick 
thy can then be study und a 
microscop and the min pres 
can be ident 
vary typ of spectrometry such as 
opt emit spectrometry infr 
absorb spectrometry and atom 
absorb spectrometry can also be 
us to ident the constitu

carbon  is a radioact isotop 
of carbon that is absorb by all 
liv thing the proport of 
carbon  to oth isotop of 
carbon remain const but when 
someth die the carbon  in 
it decay at a known rat 
whil the oth isotop stay the

thu by meas the proport 
of the carbon isotop in an 
org sampl the age of the 
sampl can be calc 

left the dat obtain 
through radiocarbon dat can oft 
be refin by calibr them with 
dat obtain by oth mean 
one such method is to comp 
the dat with thos obtain by 
dendrochronolog espec from the 
extrem longl tre the 
bristlecon pin 
far left excav grav 
can be dat by stratigraph by 
scy dat of the bon such 
as by carbon  dat 
by the typ of find pres as 
grav good and sometim by 
hist record 
thy sum bur in northern iraq 
has been dat to about  
bc 
but sev fact affect the acc 
of radiocarbon dat 
init assum that the level of 
carbon  in the environ that 
was avail to be absorb by 
liv thing remain at a 
const level subsequ research has 
shown that the amount of carbon  
vary poss as a result of 
sunspot act 
som of the dat that hav been 
obtain are theref mislead 
mak the sampl appear young or 
old than it real is 
a second problem is that the 
calc of the halfl of carbon 
 is stil being refin 
the halfl of a radioact 
isotop is the tim it tak for 
half of the radioact to disappear 
as the isotop decay 
for carbon  the halfl is 
approxim  year but sint 
thy is a cruc quant in the 
calc of any radiocarbon dat 
the mor acc it is the 
mor acc the dat wil be 
at the tim the first radiocarbon 
dat wer calc the halfl 
was thought to be around  
year and so ear dat hav 
had to be correct 
abov the method of 
dat us tre 
dendrochronolog involv tak 
sampl from timb of diff 
ag and link them togeth to 
provid an overal dat 
sequ 
test of the acc of radiocarbon 
dat against sampl of wood dat 
by dendrochronolog see below 
hav shown that radiocarbon 
year cannot alway be 
direct equ with calend year 
becaus the amount of carbon  
vary so that a dat of 
 bc in radiocarbon 
year may act be clos 
to a real dat of  bc 
to correct thy er radiocarbon dat 
are calibr by study the 
diff between radiocarbon dat and 
tre dat 
for the lat rang of radiocarbon 
dat thy calibr is 
wellest 
the tre dat are obtain from 
sampl of extrem longl tre 
such as the bristlecon pin 
thes tre grow in the southwest 
of the unit stat and som 
are ov  year old 
becaus of the difficul assocy 
with radiocarbon dat each new 
dat is giv a stat margin 
of er 
a dat of  bc plusmn  
ind a  chant that the 
real dat lie within  year 
eith sid of  bc and a 
 chant that it wil lie within 
 year eith sid of that 
dat 
despit all thes problem radiocarbon 
dat has revolv the study 
of archaeolog 
it has oft provid dat wher 
ther was prevy no method of 
dat avail at all and for 
many period acc to the 
nearest century or so is far bet 
than produc by prevy dat 
method 
oth method of dat bas on 
simil principl of meas the 
bal between decay and stabl 
isotop are being develop arid 
thes may wel becom as import 
as radiocarbon dat 
dendrochronolog also cal tre 
dat is not on us for 
calibr radiocarbon dat but 
also for provid acc dat for 
old timb 
it rely on the fact that tre 
grow an ring and that in 
som tre the thick of thes 
ring is subject to season vary 
when a tre is fel a 
pattern of an ring of vary 
thick can be seen 
by match the pattern of tre 
ring from tre of known 
dat a larg pattern of thick 
and thin ring cov hundr 
or ev thousand of year can be 
built up 
if the pattern of ring from a 
piec of und timb is match 
against a dat pattern the piec 
can also be dat 
abov wher wood surv 
us in waterlog 
condit it can be dat 
by carbon  dat or mor 
us by cut slic from the 
timb with a saw and dat 
them by their tre 
not all typ of tre provid a 
good pattern of tre ring 
howev 
pattern can be affect by 
clim which vary from reg 
to reg so that a particul 
tre pattern est in one 
are cannot be us for dat 
timb from anoth part of the 
world 
in fact timb rar surv to 
be discov on archaeolog sit 
and when they do they are not 
alway in good enough condit to 
be us for dat 
furtherm if they wer part of 
timb struct and had been 
shap not enough of the ring 
pattern may surv 
and ev if a struct timb 
can be dat ther is alway 
the poss that it was stor 
for som tim between being fel 
and being us or ev that 
it was reus timb salv from 
an ear build 
but thes problem notwithstand 
tre dat is extrem us 
and can provid dat acc to 
the nearest year 
thermoluminesc dat us 
abbrevy to tl dat is 
us for ceram artefact such as 
pottery 
thy method is bas on the fact 
that min cryst accum and 
stor energy which is releas 
when they are heat 
all clay contain such min 
and when pottery is fir the 
energy stor in the cryst is 
releas as light 
from then on the cryst 
continu to accum and stor 
energy 
by heat a sampl of 
pottery and meas the amount of 
energy releas the tim that has 
elaps sint the pot was last 
fir us when the pot 
was mad can be calc 
as with all dat method 
ther are drawback 
not all the energy releas on 
heat com from the cryst 
sint som wil be from radioact 
absorb from the soil and 
diff typ of cryst vary in 
their abl to absorb energy 
thes thing hav to be tak into 
consid when calc dat 
but the method is nonetheless 
valu 
it can also be us on som 
burnt ston tool and is 
particul us if such tool wer 
heat dur their manufact 
oth method of dat that are 
us in spec cas includ 
archaeomagnet dat us to dat 
ceram mat that hav not been 
mov sint they wer last 
heat such as the clay flo 
of a pottery kiln or a hear 
insid a hut or hous 
clay retain a record of the 
intens and direct of the 
earth magnet field when it 
was last fir becaus on 
heat the magnet oxid in the 
clay align with the prevail magnet 
field 
the earth magnet field chang 
in streng and direct ov 
tim and by meas the loc 
magnet field around the clay an 
estim of when the clay was last 
fir can be calc 
abov tak sampl of burnt 
clay for dat by archaeomagnet 
dat 
with the rang of scy dat 
method now avail archaeolog 
are bet equip than ev bef 
to construct a rely sequ of

unfortun dat by such method 
is stil rar 
no mat what the mean of obtain a

hav a dat acc to within

an object of a particul dat in

in most cas ther are

most sit do not produc remain

build pit dug for vary 
purpos or ditch for

such hol cannot be

such a sit to the publ would 
requir consid reconstruct 
below bef thy build 
on the bank of the riv tham 
in london was construct the sit 
was excav it produc import 
evid of a rom quay see 
reconstruct on the prevy 
pag 
the cho as to wheth the remain 
of a sit are preserv for publ 
display depend both on ther being 
suit remain but also on a 
suit sit and fin 
nowaday most excav are conduc 
on sit that are about to be 
destroy and so when the 
excav is fin the sit is 
left to its fat 
although in som cas part of 
the sit may surv becaus it 
lie outsid the are to be

whol sit disappear and on 
excav record and find are 
left 
but in som cas the remain 
unearth by excav are sufficy 
import and interest to be wor 
display 
if the sit is not in dang 
of being destroy it may be 
poss to rais fund to conserv 
the sit for display and the 
way the sit is pres depend 
larg on the nat of the

mosqu for exampl may need the

saf and suit access provid in

mor fragil sit oft need to be

on the rar occas when a

to be very import construct 
plan may be chang to accommod 
the display of the sit or 
the remain might be mov to 
somewh wher they can preserv 
display and enjoy by the 
publ 
many sit wher archaeolog remain 
are on publ display hav nev 
been ful excav and any 
furth excav on thes sit are 
us undertak to add to the

som sit may hav their own 
museum but in most inst 
find from any excav are kept 
in loc and nat museum 
sint museum can display very few 
of the object that they hold 
most of the find held by museum 
are in perm stor 
whil som of thes are not 
suit for display many oth 
are not seen becaus a bet 
exampl is already on display 
the import of thes stor 
find is that they form a 
research collect avail for study 
by archaeolog and oth and 
som are us for travel and 
temp exhibit and in 
teach collect on loan to 
school 
at som exceiv sit it has 
been necess to reconstruct part of 
the sit and the find for display 
in ord that they should be ful 
understood by visit 
the most dram exampl of thy 
is the jorvik cent in 
york which has a lifelik 
reconstruct of part of york in 
the vik age complet with 
sound and smel a 
reconstruct of the excav itself 
and a display of find 
dynam display such as thy mak sit 
and find mor comprehens and 
are lik to be increas us 
at excav sit and within museum 
in the fut 
left at tim it may 
be poss to conserv or reconstruct 
a sit by incorp it in 
the develop plan 
thy sit was ont that of an 
ant meet plac mound it 
was part excav and the mound 
reconstruct as part of the 
landscap design 
why interpret is necess 
unlik hist docu archaeolog 
sit and their find do not tel 
us anyth direct 
to gain inform from sit and 
find they hav to be tre 
as evid and inform has 
to be deduc from them in much 
the sam way as a detect us 
forens evid 
as has been shown dur 
the excav itself every decid 
by an excav in distinct one 
lay or context from anoth is a 
form of interpret 
in postexcav analys group of 
context are interpret as repres 
wal posthol filledin pit 
and ditch and so on bef 
being put togeth as clu to 
struct such as build and 
fent 
the process is simil to doing a 
jigsaw puzzl but without a cle 
pattern on each piec 
som sit are so import that it 
may be necess for a rescu 
op on an intern scal 
abov many import nub 
monu wer thre by flood due 
to the construct of the asw 
dam 
right aft they wer 
record thes monu at abu 
simbel wer dismantl and reassembl out 
of reach of the floodw 
exceiv in rar cas a simil 
analys has to be apply to 
find as thes hav no inscrib 
or writ record to ident 
them 
ont they hav been dat 
though their sign for the 
sit wher they wer found stil 
requir interpret 
for exampl a neolith ston axe 
found in a pit insid a rom 
build might be interpret as a 
stray find unconnect with the 
rom struct 
if the build is thought to be 
a templ howev the ston 
axe may wel be interpret as 
hav been pick up by someon 
and delib bury within the 
templ in the rom period as 
an off to the god 
the oth mas fact that mak 
interpret necess is the problem 
of accid surv 
on most sit for inst 
found alon surv mak it 
imposs to est the complet 
height or appear of build 
both for sit and for 
find the greatest problem are 
caus by the fact that org 
mat rar surv 
for exampl in most part of the 
world wood has been us 
extend for build fuel 
tool and ev machinery yet 
on in exceiv circumst doe 
wood surv 
as a result archaeolog need to 
use a gre deal of interpret 
to fil in the gap in the 
evid caus by the accid 
surv of som remain whil oth 
hav per 
with thorough analys archaeolog 
sit and find can yield a gre 
deal of evid and with skil 
interpret as wel much mean 
inform can result 
method of interpret 
ther are many techn of 
archaeolog interpret and sev 
lay at which interpret is 
necess from sort out the 
struct sequ of excav build 
to assess the plac of a nat 
in world hist 
at each level ther are broad 
approach that are near alway us 
as the bas of interpret 
the most bas level of interpret 
archaeolog remain is dur the 
postexcav work when the 
context are analys and wher 
poss dat and fit 
togeth 
as we hav seen thy involv 
a consid sort of dat in ord 
to build up a pict of the 
sit  to see for exampl 
what build ex ther and 
at what period 
the result is an approxim hist 
of the sit for exampl the 
sit may begin with the construct 
of a farmh with a few 
outbuild then a larg barn was 
built alt wer mad to the 
farmh two of the outbuild 
wer demol and so on 
on a sit with good dat 
evid for most context and easy 
est rel between them 
such an interpret is rel 
straightforward 
on som sit though the 
dat may be too imprec to be 
of particul valu and may lack 
direct rel between the 
feat 
for exampl a sit may consist 
larg of a numb of posthol 
all dat to the neolith 
period 
it may be obvy that the 
posthol repres struct but 
littl els may be immedy 
app 
in thy situ it is poss 
to try to group the posthol with 
simil charact such as dep 
diamet and so on and then to 
see if pattern of simil posthol 
rev lik struct such as 
circul or rectangul build 
thy method of analys doe not 
alway work and sometim 
interpret of such sit is littl 
bet than guesswork 

below it is not feas 
to put most find from excav 
on publ display 
instead they are hous in 
storeroom in museum to be us by 
research 
left excav are us 
carry out on sit sched for 
develop so that the archaeolog 
evid can nev be display on

the excav of the vik sit 
at york was so import 
though that the develop plan 
wer chang 
right the evid from the

been reconstruct in a very vivid 
way at the jorvik vik

furtherm it is oft poss 
to reply the artefact in ord to

econom inform is not norm 
cap of being test in the sam

as the econom is so clos 
assocy with mat evid 
by study evid for transport

many of thes fact can be

archaeolog evid but oth 
fact  such as siz of

abov a muse reconstruct

inform about soc org is

archaeolog might be abl to

abov expery can be don 
to find out how ditch silt up

such inform help archaeolog to

many ordin everyday object and

it might be obvy that an object

religy object hav been found in

thos which see how find

the divid lin between expery

becaus find and struct hav to 
be reconstruct in ord to undertak 
expery 
it is of the utmost import to 
see how sit decay and how they 
appear when they are excav and 
thes wer the earliest typ of

sit such as thy crannog can 
be tour attract but they 
can also be us as expery 
in show how sit wer construct 
and how they appear when destroy 
and excav 
ston ax hav been us in 
sev expery to find out the 
method and efficy of haft 
and to see how efficy they wer 
in fel tre 
the mark left behind on the

been us to investig the use of 
bronz and iron ax 
right reconstruct of find 
are oft don so that they can be 
bet understood study and

are mor mean when put on

it is ess though to 
ens that the reconstruct part of 
an object are easy distinct 
as in thy rest anthropomorph

one of the most common expery 
of thy kind is mak and 
fir of pottery which not 
on test method of pottery 
construct dec glaz 
and fir method but also 
leav the remain of the kiln 
itself which can be comp with 
excav exampl 
becaus vary typ of kiln 
and pottery wer in use at 
diff tim many expery of 
thy typ are need and simil 
test can be us to investig 
the manufact of til and the 
smelt of or for exampl 
but the most spectacul expery 
involv fulls reconstruct of build 
and oth struct 
most expery of thy typ hav 
so far cont on investig 
timb build with post set in 
posthol becaus thes are us 
the most difficult struct to 
interpret dur excav 
timb hous of sev diff 
period and cult hav been 
reconstruct in vary expery 
lead to a much bet understand 
of how such build wer origin 
built 
expery hav been tak stil 
furth to see how such build 
funct through use and in 
som cas hav been left to decay 
and fal down or hav been 
burnt down in ord to comp the 
result remain with excav 
evid 
bestknown to the gen publ 
perhap are expery wher 
reconstruct of ear boat and ship 
hav been us to follow and thu 
test the feas of migr rout 
which might hav been us by 
ant peopl such as the expery 
conduc by thor heyerdahl 
watercraft hav also been reconstruct 
to test how they wer manufact 
and how wel they funct as 
in the rec cas of olympia 
 a reconstruct greek 
trirem 
although funda to many aspect of 
interpret archaeolog expery 
are on now being acceiv as an 
ess branch of research and 
ther is stil a gre deal of 
work to be don in all 
spher 
abov top thy reconstruct

ruin of a miss church in peco 
pueblo new mexico 
abov as long as the circumf

be est it is poss to 
do reconstruct draw 
archaeolog reconstruct 
apart from thos us in archaeolog 
expery reconstruct main show 
what sit and find wer lik 
when they wer in use 
the mas of archaeolog find are 
brok dam or decay and 
it is us difficult to env 
what a sit look lik in its 
heyday by simply look at the 
excav remain 
abov an aer view of 
a mediev castl at totn 
england 
artefact are frequ reconstruct 
bef they are put on display 
which may involv littl mor than 
repair work such as stick 
piec of pot togeth and fil 
any remain gap 
in oth cas howev a 
complet reconstruct of an object is 
put on display alongsid the remain 
of the origin which may be 
corrod or dam 
thes reconstruct are oft mad of

abov right an art 
impress bas on archaeolog

as wel as phys reconstruct draw

draw of object publ as 
research dat for use by archaeolog 
frequ incorp an el of 
reconstruct but thy should he 
cle distinct from the surv 
port of the object 
for draw for display howev 
thy distinct is us omit 
sint the purpos of the draw 
is to giv an overal impress of 
the origin object 
such draw can be display alongsid 
the surv remain of the 
object 
left it is us easy 
to build a model rath than a 
fulls reconstruct and yet thy 
can stil giv a real impress 
of a sit 
draw and paint are main us 
to portray an archaeolog sit at 
a particul point in tim 
such repres hav to be very 
car research ens that 
as far as poss every detail is 
correct 
ev so ther is oft insufficy 
evid to portray the whol sit 
in detail and art need to 
use their imagin to fil thes 
detail in 
left a sery of model 
or paint can vivid portray the 
develop and appear of a 
sit 
such model hav to be car 
research and don acc to 
scal 
thy is a model of the busy 
waterfront of the rom city of 
london in about ad  bas 
on a sery of rec archaeolog 
excav includ investig of 
submerg ship 
ev with the cost of detail 
research a set of reconstruct 
draw of a sit is us far 
cheap than a phys reconstruct 
in any cas such detail 
draw are gen need as 
prep for a phys 
reconstruct 
draw can oft giv view of 
the sit that are difficult or 
imposs to achiev with a phys 
reconstruct such as aer or 
cutaway view show both the 
intery and extery of a build 
at the sam tim 
apart from their use for research 
such reconstruct draw and paint 
are us for display purpos for 
sit j visit and are oft 
publ as illust in book 
and magazin 
thy typ of illust is not 
confin to build but is also 
us for struct such as bridg 
fronty def ship and ev 
for peopl 
it can be us to show almost 
anyth from what an object 
look lik to how it was 
mad how it was us and how 
it was found 
a method of reconstruct which 
incorp som of the adv of 
both phys reconstruct and 
reconstruct draw is the scal 
model 
such model of sit and struct 
hav the adv of giv a 
threedimend view and show the sit 
in its entir 
model too can be construct to 
giv a view of both the 
intery and extery of a

their on problem is that they do 
not convey the feel and atmosph 
of a sit and oft appear less 
auth than a skil reconstruct

fullsc lifes reconstruct giv

an altern to thy typ of

what next 
what to do if you want to know 
mor 
whatev approach you wish to 
follow the first step is to 
visit your loc libr 
thy wil us hav a select 
of archaeolog book and wil 
prob hav detail of archaeolog 
socy in the loc and any

it with hundr of book 
avail about all aspect of 
archaeolog it is as wel to 
sampl a few of thes to get a

many peopl find it worthwhil to 
join an archaeolog socy 
such socy us off a

oth act such as the chant to 
particip in fieldwork or excav 
som hav their own libr of 
archaeolog book for use by their 
memb us contain a much 
wid rang than are held by publ 
libr or are avail in 
bookshop 
in many area it is poss 
to enrol for adult educ class 
in archaeolog 
thes are oft run by univers 
extram depart as ev 
class although daytim cours are 
held in som area and the 
rang of cours on off tend to 
depend on the lect that are 
avail  introduc and bas 
cours are popul and are quit 
frequ held 
most cours are for educ and 
enjoy on and do not lead 
to a qual but som 
cours lead to a diplom and 
many univers off parttim and 
fulltim degr cours in archaeolog 
abov archaeolog are becom 
mor aw of the need to provid 
access on excav for tour 
loc peopl and for repres of 
the fund body 
ont you hav mad the first step 
toward find out mor about 
archaeolog it is lik that you 
wil nev turn back 
what to do if you find someth 
many archaeolog sit and find 
are discov by peopl as they 
are going about their everyday 
work 
although many go unrecogn stray 
find are mor common discov than 
sit and every one is pot 
import ad to archaeolog 
evid and perhap lead to 
the discovery of a new sit 
the own of archaeolog find 
depend on the loc law in 
som country all archaeolog artefact 
are autom the property of the 
stat and hav to be report 
whil in oth the find belong to 
the own of the land on which 
they wer found but whatev 
the own each find need 
to be prop record if it is 
to be of any use 
archaeolog 
below ther are a vary 
of lect off by museum and 
archaeolog socy both in the 
lunchtim and in the ev 
if an archaeolog find is 
discov a detail record of 
the circumst of the discovery and 
the exact findspot should be 
compil 
thy should be acc enough for 
the findspot to be plot on a 
map and for someon els to be 
abl to find the loc 
then report the find to an 
appropry auth  a loc 
muse is us a good start 
point sint it may employ an 
archaeolog 
if ther is no loc muse 
ther may be a profess 
archaeolog in the are perhap 
work for the loc auth 
eith of thes should be abl to 
adv on the import of the 
find and what to do next but 
if ther is no one in the

should be abl to adv on who 
to contact 
left visit archaeolog 
sit is a worthwhil pursuit 
particul for thos abl to visit 
mor remot and wellpreserv sit 
thy is machu picchu the 
lost inc city in

discovery of archaeolog sit should 
be dealt with in much the sam 
way 
if the sit is an obvy landscap 
feat it is very lik to 
hav been record already 
if it has been discov dur 
the cours of earthmov for

howev the sit may be tot

import that loc archaeolog 
are alert as soon as poss so 
that som kind of record of the
