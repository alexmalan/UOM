i am afraid that by tak the 
extraordin meas of stapl thy 
report becaus som of the

amnesty has again giv cred to 
the believ that rec tort in 
kuwait has been mor terr than 
in any oth part of the 
world wherea the repugn pattern 
of paininflict describ are all 
too famili from ir from 
myanm amin ugand a

simply publ an object report 
the inf that exceiv evil 
ex dur the occup of

i feel amnesty has to provid a 
quiet mor bal overview of 
a reg in ord to maintain its 
impart and cred and to 
op effect
