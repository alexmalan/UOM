the environ protect ag say the 
hunt to find substitut for ozonedeplet chem wil go much 
quick without strict govern reg of the chem 
industry 
epa spokesm chry ric said the ag policy is volunt 
coop  instead of strong govern control  becaus epa 
has receiv excel coop from the industry 
ric was react to a rec gen account off report 
that conclud the epa policy is fail to ens the saf 
test of chem that wil tak the plac of 
chlorofluorocarbon or cfcs 
by not start the lengthy reg process now epa wil 
find itself un to quick restrict use of many substitut 
shown to endang hum heal and the environ the gao said 
the gao congress investig ag said epa should use its 
pow to demand unpubl test result and quick slap control 
on substitut believ to endang the environ or hum 
the unit stat and the nat europ commun hav 
pledg to ban chlorofluorocarbon by   surpass the goal 
of the  mont protocol which requir they be halv by the 
end of the century 
cfcs and rel chem cal halon are stabl and 
nontox when releas into the atmosph but  to  year 
lat when they ris  mil to the stratosph their 
chem bond are brok apart 
scy say their chlorin atom destroy ozon allow mor 
of the sun ultraviolet ray to reach ear caus mor skin 
cant and eye cataract and suppress hum immun system 
the rec gen account off report cal the decid 
to rely on volunt coop a cours that would allow ev 
produc of cfc altern by anyon in any amount and for 
any use without pry not  or an epa saf review 
but the epa ric count we feel us that coop 
rel is going to obtain the inform we need on a much 
quick track 
we hav very gre concern ov tox test ric said 
ad that epa has not rul out us its ful auth to 
reg the industry if wer not get the coop we 
need 
its a quest of how you do it as quick as poss whil 
everyon is clam for new compound as quick as poss 
said kevin fay of the al for respons cfc policy 
repres cfc produc and us 
the concern is youv got som policy mak in congress 
say wev got to go fast and you hav reg struct 
that would slow it down he said comp the dilemm to 
sit at an intersect with both red and gre light 
the tox subst control act allow epa not on to demand 
industry test result but to ord adv not from any 
company plan to convert chem design for oth use into 
cfc substitut 
giv the import of the saf issu we believ that 
epa approach to assess the saf of cfc  chem 
substitut should includ the use of the two tsca auth 
the gao said in a report request by the chairm of the hous 
energy and commerc commit john d dingel dmich 
the gao said depend on volunt coop is a mistak 
becaus epa prevy attempt to gath test inform 
from cfc produc in decemb  result in incomplet dat 
by ord the test result epa off could determin if a 
chem pres an unreason heal or environ risk 
and if so could requir test to determin the spec risk 
if necess the ag could tak act rang from 
label requir to a complet ban 
adv not of new us for chem would let epa review 
the saf of thes new us and quick control any subst 
pos a dang 
if epa determin the inform was inadequ to ens the 
saf of the new use the ag could requir mor test and
