"he

then
 she
 would
 never

 and
 tonight
 she
 had
 promis

to

jenna
 smile
 to
 herself
 and
 shut

the

.
she
 knew

 wa
 browni
 night
,
otherwis
 she
 wouldn
't
 have
 been

abl
 to
 get
 shirlei
 out
 until

her
 long
-suffer
 husband
 came
 home
.
at
 thi
 moment
 she
 didn
't
 realli

need
 a
 neighbour
, not
 even
 a

good
 on
.
the
 letter
 wa
 wait
, ly

in
 her
 pocket
 in
 a
 demand
 wai
 as

if
 it
 had
 control
 of
 her
.
she
 took
 it
 out
, not
 look

at
 it
 as
 she
 walk
 into
 the

kitchen
, tear
 the
 envelop
 as

she
 went
.
who
 could
 be
 write
 from
 franc
?
her
 connect
 with
 franc
 wa
 tenuou

to
 sai
 the
 least
 --- a
 fragil

link
 broken
 long
 ago
.
her
 mouth
 twist
 wryli
; at

twenti
-four
 she
 should
 have
 put
 all

that
 asid
, but
 it
 linger
 on

like
 a
 bitter
 legaci
.
just
 the
 sight
 of
 the
 stamp
 had

been
 enough
 to
 set
 her
 heart

beat
 uneasili
 and
 she
 had
 to

fight
 down
 the
 urg
 to
 put
 off

read
 the
 word
 someon
 had
 written

to
 her
.
it
 took
 her
 sever
 second
 to

absorb
 the
 letter
 although
 it
 did

not
 in
 ani
 wai
 fill
 the
 on

sheet
 of
 paper
.

 hospit
.
she
 drop
 the
 letter
 on
 the

kitchen
 tabl
, stare
 at
 it

bleakli
, her
 ey
 almost
 mesmeris

by
 the
 on
 name
 --- lemarchand
.
how
 wa
 it
 that
 after
 so
 long

that
 name
 could
 strike
 out
 at

her
, bring
 back
 the
 long

lost
 desol
, the
 raw
 feel
 of

reject
?
there
 were
 no
 condol
, no

floweri
 word
, noth
 but
 stark

fact
, not
 even
 the
 normal

end
.
he
 mere
 sign
 hi
 name
 at
 the

bottom
 of
 the
 sheet
, firm
,
black
 and
 imperi
.
alain
 lemarchand
.
her
 mother
's
 face
 came
 swim

into
 her
 mind
, blot
 out
 the

sight
 of
 the
 messag
 from
 so
 far

awai
.
it
 would
 never
 be
 her
 father
's

face
 that
 materialis
; how
 could

it
 be
?
she
 had
 been
 eight
 year
 old
 and

that
 wa
 sixteen
 year
 ago
.
even
 if
 he
 look
 the
 same
, she

could
 not
 rememb
 him
.
she
 onli
 rememb
 her
 mother
 and

the
 grief
 that
 the
 name
 lemarchand

had
 brought
.
everi
 instinct
 warn
 her
 to
 tear

the
 letter
 up
, to
 burn
 it
,
to
 destroi
 it
 and
 never
 think
 of

it
 again
.
her
 father
 would
 not
 rememb
 her

either
 becaus
 she
 wa
 no
 longer
 eight

year
 old
 and
 heartbroken
.
why
 should
 he
 want
 to
 see
 her
?
he
 had
 not
 want
 to
 see
 her

onc
 in
 all
 the
 long
 year
.
it
 took
 a
 great
 mental
 effort
 to

move
 and
 go
 upstair
 to
 chang
;
even
 then
, she
 had
 to
 keep
 her

mind
 blank
, and
 it
 wa
 onli

as
 she
 cook
 the
 even
 meal
,
everi
 action
 mechan
, that
 she

thought
 clearli
 again
.
how
 had
 thi
 man
 found
 her
?
how
 did
 he
 know
 anyth
 about

her
?
until
 she
 wa
 sixteen
 thei
 had
 been

constantli
 move
 and
 there
 had
 never

been
 anyon
 left
 behind
 to
 pass

on
 her
 address
.
her
 father
 had
 never
 bother
 to

find
 out
, so
 how
 had
 thi

frenchman
 succeed
?
it
 wa
 too
 big
 a
 puzzl
 and

she
 let
 it
 go
 although
 it
 gnaw

awai
 at
 the
 back
 of
 her
 mind
.
should
 she
 go
 to
 franc
?
a
 last
 request
?
could
 she
 face
 it
 in
 ani
 case

without
 show
 the
 bitter
?
thei
 said
 that
 everi
 action
 of
 life

show
 on
 the
 face
, in
 the

express
.
sure
 russel
 bryant
 must
 have
 some

sign
 on
 him
 of
 hi
 past
 life
,
then
?
could
 a
 man
 who
 desert
 hi
 wife

and
 child
 for
 anoth
 woman
 get

off
 free
 without
 scar
?
her
 mother
 had
 born
 scar
.
she
 had
 been
 coldli
 beauti
 until

the
 dai
 she
 di
, but
 noth

had
 brought
 her
 happi
.
she
 had
 laugh
, live
 a

perfectli
 normal
 life
, shoulder
 the

respons
 of
 be
 alon
 to
 bring

up
 her
 daughter
, but
, with
 a

child
's
 uncanni
 insight
, jenna
 had

known
 that
 her
 mother
 had
 never

recov
.
when
 the
 initi
 grief
 of
 the

desert
 had
 pass
 she
 had
 known

better
 than
 to
 mention
 her
 father
's

name
.
she
 wa
 told
 the
 fact
.
russel
 bryant
 had
 gone
 to
 franc

to
 marri
 a
 french
 widow
 call

lemarchand
.
he
 care
 noth
 for
 hi
 wife
 and

daughter
 and
 thei
 must
 wipe
 him

from
 their
 mind
.
jenna
 had
 never
 known
 if
 that

last
 advic
 had
 come
 from
 her

mother
 or
 if
 it
 had
 been
 her

father
's
 order
.
if
 it
 wa
, he
 had
 certainli

follow
 it
 scrupul
 himself
.
not
 onc
 in
 the
 long
 year
 had

he
 attempt
 to
 get
 in
 touch
,
to
 correspond
 with
 a
 daughter
 he

had
 been
 all
 too
 readi
 to

abandon
.
and
 now
 he
 want
 to
 see
 her
!
it
 seem
 almost
 a
 mockeri
, a

travesti
 of
 what
 should
 have
 been
.
in
 her
 teenag
 year
 she
 had

thought
 it
 out
 carefulli
.
she
 had
 seen
 her
 friend
 with
 their

own
 father
 and
 her
 more
 matur

outlook
 had
 pinpoint
 the
 crime

readili
.
peopl
 divorc
, left
 each
 other

--- grown
 men
 and
 women
 who

reach
 the
 decis
 to
 part
.
thei
 clung
 to
 their
 children
,
though
, share
 them
 equal
,
neither
 partner
 prepar
 to
 let

go
.
she
 had
 not
 been
 in
 that

posit
.
her
 own
 father
 had
 left
 her

readili
, left
 her
 to
 an

uncertain
 futur
, hi
 love
 for
 some

glamor
 frenchwoman
 overrid
 hi
 love

and
 duti
 to
 hi
 own
 child
.
she
 had
 felt
 worthless
, doubli

desert
, and
 had
 final
 wipe

him
 from
 her
 mind
, onli
 a

faint
 bitter
 left
, a

hollow
, incomplet
 feel
 she
 would

alwai
 carri
.
lemarchand
!
and
 who
 wa
 alain
 lemarchand
?
a
 rel
?
the
 woman
's
 brother
?
did
 the
 woman
 herself
 feel
 too

much
 guilt
 to
 write
?
jenna
 left
 the
 meal
 to
 keep
 hot

and
 went
 to
 freshen
 up
, tell

herself
 that
 she
 would
 consid
 it

coldli
 and
 then
 decid
, but
 in

realiti
 she
 wa
 churn
 up
 insid
,
a
 desir
 to
 hide
 from
 thi

uppermost
, but
 a
 deep
-seat
 and

almost
 morbid
 curios
 urg
 her
 to

go
 to
 franc
 and
 see
 the
 man

who
 wa
 noth
 to
 her
 at
 all
,
not
 even
 a

 to
 rememb
.
she
 had
 made
 her
 decis
 befor

glyn

.
she
 would
 not
 go
.
she
 would
 not
 get
 in
 touch
 with
 thi

frenchman
 who
 had
 written
 so

imperi
.
she
 ow
 her
 father
 noth
, not

even
 the
 duti
 to
 clear
 hi
 guilti

conscienc
 at
 the
 end
.
she
 would
 not
 let
 on

.
glyn
 thought
 differ
, hi
 steadi

voic
 and
 cool
 logic
 urg
 her
 to

see
 that
 she

"you

 point

out
.
"if

you
'll
 have

jenna
 look
 across
 at
 him
 as

thei

 in
 the

sit

 that
 still
 bore
 the

sign

 she
 felt
 a

 of
 unusu
 irrit

"all

"how

he
 look

glyn
 look

"there

"she

jenna
 felt
 the
 rise
 of
 annoy

that
 came
 when
 ani

made
 of
 her

, and
 he
 let

the
 subject

 the

fact
 that

 with

she

how

 had
 her

for
 the
 first

, tonight
,
she
 had
 look

realli
 look
 at

 after

glyn
's
 observ

no
, she
 didn

the
 depriv
 had
 been
 the
 loss

of
 her

, the
 constant
 loss

of

.
materi
 thing
 thei

 though
 thei

to

 hous
 she
 could
 not

actual

 feel
 that
 thei
 had

move
 down

 at

the

 had

never

in

, the

 wa

cast
, she
 had
 made
 up
 her

mind
.
tomorrow
 she
 would
 telephon

frenchman
.
she
 would
 telephon
 in
 her

lunch

.
she
 hope
 he
 spoke
 english
 as

 as

he
 wrote
 it
 and
 she
 hope
 too

that
 hi
 slightli
 censori
 tone
 did

not
 surfac
 as
 he
 met
 her
 in

pari
.
there
 had
 been
 someth
 of
 a

reproof
 in

, even
 though

no
 word
 of
 it
 had
 been
 written

openli
.
it
 had
 left
 her
 a
 littl
 aw

and
 she
 made
 a
 move
 to
 look
 at

 again
 as
 it
 lai
 on

.
she
 never
 complet
 the

it
 had
 disturb
 her
 enough
, and

even
 if
 the
 unwritten
 reproof
 had
 been

sole
 in

 imagin
 she

wa
 not
 about
 to

check
 it

she
 stare
 uneasili
 at
 the

envelop
, at
 the
 black

hand
, at
 the
 french
 stamp
, and

then
 she
 put
 out
 the
 light
 and

went
 to

.
tomorrow
 she
 would
 hear
 hi

and
 she
 wa
 not

she
 knew
 it
 would
 take

 so
 had

besid
, it
 seem
 to
 be
 terribl

import
 to
 get
 the
 better
 of
 on

arrog
 frenchman
.
she
 didn

 like
 the
 wai
 he
 had

he
 had

noth

 when

, he

realis
 she

the

 could
 just
 sit

there
 and
 monsieur
 lemarchand
's

could
 sit

wait

glyn
 told
 her
 it
 wa
 unreason
,
but
 she
 just
 didn

it
 seem
 to
 her
 to
 be
 the

nearest
 thing
 to

 justic
 that

would
 ever
 present
 itself
.
noth
 could
 hurt
 her
 mother
 now

and
 noth
 could
 hurt

she
 couldn

she
 felt

 now
 about

burst
 of
 warm
 concern
.
it
 had
 been
 a
 trick
 and
 she

had
 almost
 fallen
 for
 it
.
she
 still
 felt
 the
 power
 of
 those

strong
 finger
, the
 protect
 that

had
 seem
 to
 swim
 around
 her
.
if

 had
 simpli
 gone
 straight
 to

 she
 would

even

it

if
 anyon
 els
 had
 had
 thi
 odd

habit
 of
 repeat
 himself
, jenna

would
 have
 laugh
, but
 with

ned
 clark
 it
 wasn
't
 at
 all

laughabl
.
it
 wa
 rather
 sinist
.
he
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 peculiar

habit
, on
 of
 them
 be
 to

stare
 hard
 at
 you
 with
 steeli

ey
.
"er
 --- what
 kind
 of

he
 stare
 at

 he

lean

"i

 on

 by
 some
 unseen

and

.
"your

thi
 time
 it
 wa
 jenna
 who
 wa

astound
.
she
 had
 never
 heard
 such
 nonsens
.
her
 mother
 had
 di
 a
 veri
 short

time
 ago
, in
 realiti
, and

jenna
 had
 been
 more
 than
 capabl
 of

deal
 with
 her
 own
 well

.
she
 had
 a
 job
, a
 hous
 and

enough
 monei
 to
 live
 fairli
 well
;
in
 fact
 she
 had
 been
 quit

surpris
 at
 the
 amount
 of
 monei

her
 mother
 had
 left
 her

jenna
's
 shock
 look
 must
 have

reach
 some
 deep
 core
 of
 humil

in

.
he
 flush
 uneasili
.
"what
 i

 is

explain

"thank

i
 did
 realis
 that
," jenna

said
 quietli
, still

 at
 him

warili
.
"we
 were

after

"so

"your

" what

jenna
 struggl
 to
 her
 feet
,
but
 he
 wave
 her
 back
 to
 her

.
"all
 verifi
 if
 you
 wish
 to

bother

thi
 of

 is
 not
 the
 reason

for
 thi
 littl

littl
 chat
!
she
 felt
 as
 if
 she
 were
 in
 the

middl
 of
 a
 minefield
.
her

 had
 left
 them
 for
 a

woman
 in

there
 wa

what

she
 had
 no

"monsieur

he
 went

"in

"why

jenna
 found

she
 had
 been

 did

not

 would

take

 toward

 she
 had

no

she
 also

 he

went
 along

"is

the

quit

when

she
 had
 wild
 vision
 of
 be

he
 might
 want
 to
 see

"do

she
 had
 the
 satisfact
 of
 see

mr
 clark
's
 face
 redden
 with

embarrass
.
at
 least
 it
 got
 her
 out
 of
 hi

offic
 without
 more
 lectur
, and

when
 glyn
 present
 himself
 rather

smugli
 she
 told
 him
 smartli
 that

she

 go
 to

she
 intend

noth

somehow

 she
 had
 been

manoeuvr
 into

 weak

femal
, border
 on
 the

 of

dim

she

in

break

she
 certainli
 need
 a
 break
 from

glyn

 if
 she
 never
 saw
 mr

 clark
 again
 it
 would
 be
 too

soon
.
she
 had
 an
 open

 arrang
 at

she
 wa
 to

 when
 she
 felt

up
 to

.
she
 could
 spare

alain
 took
 her

 with

remark

 sound
 like
 anoth

the
 origin
 answer
 had
 been
 from
 a

woman
 and
 the

 had
 baffl

her
.
all
 jenna
 had
 been
 abl
 to
 do

it
 brought
 forth
 a
 flood
 of

 familiar

and
 yet
 strang
 and
 jenna
 wa

utterli
 at
 a
 loss
 as
 to
 how
 to

answer

tingl
 ran
 down
 her
 spine
 and
 her

mouth
 went
 quit
 dry
.
the
 silenc
 held
 for
 a
 while

and
 then
 she
 heard
 a
 low
 laugh

that
 seem
 to
 trace
 itself
 right

down
 her

 too
.
"mademoisel

and
 jenna
 had
 steel
 herself
 for

she

chapter

the
 hous
 wa
 beauti
 and
 the

sight
 of
 it
 silenc

.
it
 wa
 about
 twenti
-five
 mile
 west

of

, set
 in
 sever
 acr

of
 ground
 with
 tall
 tree
, and

it
 wa
 not
 at
 all
 what
 she
 had

expect
.
she
 hadn
't
 given
 much
 thought

to
 what
 the
 hous
 that
 her
 father

had
 left
 would
 be
 like
, but

she
 had
 not
 gain
 the
 impress

that
 it
 wa
 anyth
 like
 thi
.
certainli
 she
 had
 not
 envisag
 thi

grand
 and
 eleg
 resid
.
it
 wa
 white
, three
 storei

high
, the
 lower
 window
 arch
,
as
 wa
 the
 front
 door
.
a
 doubl
 flight
 of
 shallow
 step

led
 to
 the
 door
, which
 wa

flank
 by
 stone
 pot
 of
 flower

now
 brilliant
 with
 spring
 colour
.
"it

as
 the

 swept
 up

 torn

from

she
 rememb
 sai
 that
 she
 might

veri
 well
 bui
 out
 the
 other
 and

live
 in
 the
 properti
 herself
.
on
 thing
 wa
 sure
: she

couldn
't
 afford
 it
, becaus
 she

hadn

 even
 imagin
 anyth
 so

grand
.
her
 father
 must
 have
 been
 realli

success
 to
 have
 bought
 thi
 hous

and
 had
 it
 alter

so
 close
 to

, it
 would

be
 expens

 must

be

 in
 hi
 work
 too
 if

he
 could
 afford
 simpli
 to

 hi

share
 awai
 to
 hi

it
 annoi
 her
 to

 he
 had

imagin
 she
 would
 do
 the

.
even
 a
 third
-share
 of
 thi

would
 repres
 a
 fortun
 to
 most

peopl

it
 would
 be
 interest
 to
 know

what
 he

 to
 offer
 her

to

and
 anywai
, what
 about
 the

it

she

 had
 been
 lost

it
 hadn

she
 wa
 about
 to

 the
 woman

whose
 glamour
 had
 brought
 her
 father

to
 franc
, who
 had
 driven
 him

to
 desert
 hi
 own

french
 women
 were
 chic
, well

groom
, and
 if
 all
 the
 magazin

were
 to
 be
 believ
 thei
 were

almost
 invari
 beauti

she
 caught

 in

 smooth
 her

fair
 hair

she
 wa
 wear

 she
 heard

the
 rapid
 flow
 of

 and
 knew
 that
 now
 she

wa
 about
 to
 meet
 the
 woman
 she

had
 unconsci
 hate
 for
 the
 whole

of

she
 could
 hardli

 small
 dark

woman

thi
 small

 woman
 with

short
 grei
 hair
 and
 a
 plain

face
?
oh
, she
 had
 the
 chic
 that

seem
 to
 be
 the
 birthright
 of
 all

french
 women
, but
 she
 had
 noth

els
 at

, unless
 it

 the

rather
 fine
 dark
 ey

 onli

thing
 she
 had
 in

 with

"jenna

with

 in

it

 she
 had

read

 it
 had
 meant
 noth

 now
 she
 realli
 knew

what

she
 could

she
 wa
 comfort
 with

she

he
 seem

 her
 to
 be

splendid
 to

; even
 glyn

would
 not

"of

jenna
 wasn

it

 that

 in

 of

on
 thing
 about

 that
 wa

probabl
 on

 side
: he

had
 the
 abil
 to
 drain
 awai
 her

tension

 make

 feel
 better

on

, if
 he

hadn

 keen
 on

there
 would
 not

 she
 would
 not

it

 did

get
 readi

 to

her

, in

she
 felt
 she
 ow
 it
 to

to

even
 at

jenna
 could
 still

the

 and
 the
 more

,
an
 intrud
 who
 wa
 here
 to
 rock

the

 of

alter
 their

she
 could
 not
 understand
 why
 alain

had
 insist

 she
 be

unless

 it

in

 thi

 attitud

after

, when

gave

now
 jenna
 knew

 afford
 to

a

 deal
 of

 for

so
 why

why

the

she
 had
 just
 finish

 wa
 glad
 that
 claudin
 had

not

she
 did
 not

 proof

of

 been
 led

in

he
 didn

he
 glare
 down
 into

 and
 then
 swept
 her
 up
 in

on
 smooth
 movement
, carri
 her

into
 the
 darken
 barn
 and
 grimli

mount
 the
 wooden
 step
.
she
 struggl
 furious
, but
 it
 wa

littl
 us
, and
 at
 the
 top
 of

the
 step
 he
 set
 her
 on
 her

feet
.
as
 far
 as
 jenna
 could
 see
 there
 wa

noth
 there
.
it
 wa
 dim
 with
 the
 atmospher
 of

all
 old
 barn
 --- straw
,
dust
, and
 in
 thi
 case
 too
 the

sweet
 smell
 of
 store
 appl
.
there
 wa
 no
 sign
 of
 a
 studio

and
 for
 a
 minut
 she
 expect
 to

find
 that
 alain
 had
 been
 mere

frighten
 her
 --- some
 hidden

cruelti
 to
 make
 her
 feel

uncomfort
, anoth
 chanc
 to

embarrass

he
 look
 down
 at
 her

the

"i

 snap

"come

he
 grip
 her
 wrist
 firmli
 and

led
 her
 to
 a
 door
.
so
 far
 she
 had
 seen
 noth
 but

a
 normal
 barn
 --- bale
 of

hai
, rack
 of
 appl
, a
 few

garden
 tool
 --- but
 now
 she

found
 herself
 forc
 into
 the
 other

side
 of
 the
 top
 floor
 and
 it

wa
 certainli
 differ
, so
 differ

in
 fact
 that
 as
 alain
 releas
 her

she
 walk
 forward
 of

obvious
 the
 top
 of
 the
 long
 barn

had
 been
 divid
 into
 two
.
thi
 half
 wa
 a
 studio
 and
 a

good

it
 wa
 clear
 that
 the
 light

from
 thi
 side
 wa
 better
 even

without
 the

 of
 huge

in
 the
 roof
.
it
 wa
 neat
 and
 clean
, the

smell
 of
 paint
 and
 thinner

over
 from

 smell
 of

 and

appl
.
there
 wa
 certainli
 no

there
 were
 two

and
 on

 did
 not

know
 --- but
 the
 thing
 that
 wa

most
 touch
, the
 thing
 that

stop
 her
 forward
 momentum
 wa
 a

chair
 by
 the
 lower
 window
,
obvious
 place
 to
 look
 out
 over

the
 vallei
 and
 the
 distant

.
it

he
 would
 certainli
 conclud
 that
 she

 and

take

she
 couldn

the

no

 the

 drawn

it
 would
 be
 a
 few

 no

mother
 that
 she
 had
 seen
 the

like

at

at

she
 turn

when

 she

would
 sit
 down

she
 would

the

it
 had
 also
 been
 her
 first
 real

brush
 with
 masculin
 anger
 and
 the

effect
 frighten
 her
.
it
 wa
 easi
 enough
 to
 rationalis
,
to
 calmli
 explain
 to
 herself
 why
 he

had
 done
 that
, but
 her
 sens

went
 their
 own
 wai
, rememb
 not

the
 insult
 but
 the
 strength
 of
 hi

arm
, the
 tang
 of
 hi
 skin
,
the
 instinct
 feel
 that
 hi
 lip

had
 want
 to
 soften
 and
 sooth

her
.
what
 nonsens
!
he
 had
 been
 angri
 and
 noth

more
.
on
 thing
 wa
 sure
: when
 she

met
 him
 again
 it
 would
 be
 alain

who
 would
 feel
 uncomfort
 becaus

there
 wa
 no
 forgiv
 an
 action

like
 that
.
jenna
 came
 back
 to
 the
 present

rapidli
 and
 painfulli
 as
 she
 trip

over
 a
 fallen
 and
 partial
 sunken

log
.
for
 the
 past
 few
 minut
 she
 had

not

 been

 much
 attent

to

 she

round
 worriedli
.
now
 she
 wa
 not
 orient
 at
 all

and
 for
 all
 she
 knew
 she
 could

have
 been
 go
 round
 in
 circl
.
it
 wa
 a
 great
 relief
 therefor
 to

hear
 the
 sound
 of
 a
 pass

car
, it
 speed
 assur
 her
 that

the
 main
 road
 wa
 in
 front
 of
 her
.
all
 she
 had
 to
 do
 wa
 go

forward
 and
 then
 turn
 to

left
 as
 she
 found
 the
 road
.
her

 and
 as
 she

look
 down
 she
 wa
 surpris
 to

see
 that
 she
 had
 also
 graze
 the

skin
 there
.
she
 must
 look
 quit
 a
 sight
.
the
 sooner
 she
 got
 back
 on
 to
 the

track
 the
 better
.
if
 she
 met
 the
 girl
 mari
 on

the
 wai
 back
 there
 would
 be
 even

more
 for
 her
 to
 tell
 mademoisel

rabier

the

 through

the
 thin

 and
 jenna
 had
 to

scrambl
 down
 a

, cross
 a

ditch
 and
 she
 wa

 on
 the

firm

 of

.
she
 sincer
 hope
 that
 she
 could

make
 it
 to

 befor

 becaus
 she
 knew
 exactli

what

she

 becaus
 of

when
 she
 put

 she
 felt

 she

wa

 when
 a

car

" tout

jenna
 look
 up
 from

contempl

 to
 find

a
 young

 watch
 her
 from

she
 had
 to
 admit
 that
 he
 look

more
 worri

and
 thi
 brought
 a
 small
 smile

of
 relief
 to
 her

.
"i

"ah

"not

"i

"i

he

and
 jenna
 felt
 a

just
  becaus
  he

he

 that

didn

she
 had
 stupidli
 given

 he
 had
 latch

no

"qu

hi
 sharp
 question
 brought
 a

flush
 to
 the
 face
 of
 the

who
 wa

 she
 decid
 to
 get

her

"i

it
 wa
 difficult
 to
 look
 haughti

and
 defiant
 when
 she
 knew

what

 still

held
 the

even
 so
, now
 that
 alain

 there

she
 felt
 safe
 enough
 to
 go

there

" i

alain

no

the

 wa
 wonderfulli

 and

afterward
 she
 spent
 a

 put

with

 jenna
 couldn

 at

as
 to
 cool

 wa
 no

she

 now
 in

 everi

time
 she

it
 wa
 like

 she
 never

.
who
 would
 have
 thought
 when
 she

had
 first
 seen
 him
 in
 england
 that

he
 would
 drag
 her
 into

, order
 her
 about

"we

she
 made
 a

it
 be
 imposs

 hit
 him
 with

 slid

into
 the

 and
 kept

silent
.
onc
 again
 she
 wa
 be

 to

wave
 in

 of
 claudin
 and
 she
 knew

it
.
she
 regret
 the
 effort
 she
 had

put
 into

almost
 everyth
 she
 did

 right

into

the

it

 thei

almost
 upon

 befor
 she
 realli

had
 the
 chanc
 to
 look

her
 first
 thought
 were
 that
 it
 wa

a
 great
 shame
 to
 turn
 such
 a

wonder
 build
 into
 a
 restaur
 and

hotel
.
it
 seem
 utterli
 incongru
 that
 there

were
 car
 park
 outsid
 on
 the

wide
 circular

 --- carriag

would
 have
 look
 more
 appropri
.
the
 place
 wa
 not
 a
 veri
 grand

huge
 ch

, but
 it
 wa

impos
 and
 romant
 nevertheless
, with

lawn
 terrac
 sweep
 down
 to
 the

, great
 old

 around
 it

and
 a
 small

 to
 on

that
 actual

as
 thei
 stop
 jenna
 wa
 veri

reluct
 to
 get
 out

suddenli
, she
 didn
't
 want
 to

meet
 claudin
 rabier
.
she
 had
 the
 feel
 that
 thi

morn
's
 event
 would
 have
 been

faithfulli
 report
 by
 mari
 and
 she

sincer
 hope
 that
 the
 girl
 did

not
 add
 to
 her
 earn
 by

as
 a

 here
.
it
 wa
 imposs
 to
 refus
 to

move

 jenna
 found

herself
 be

 out
 of
 the

and
 across
 the
 gravel
 drive
 toward

the
 ivi

 entranc
 of
 the

ch

.
marguerit
 wa
 busili
 describ
 the

place
 to
 her
 and
 point
 out
 how

well
 it
 had
 been
 restor
, but

jenna
 wa
 more
 awar
 of
 alain
's

dark
 silenc
.
she
 hung
 on
 to
 on

determinedli
.
tomorrow
 wa

as

 as
 she
 knew
, alain
 wa
 go

back
 to

 in
 the
 afternoon
 and

she
  wa
 go
 with
 him
,
whether
 he
 like
 it
 or
 not
!
at
 least
 the
 rabier
 had
 had
 the

good
 sens
 to
 leav
 the
 insid
 of

the
 ch
&acirc

 as
 it
 had
 been
,
at
 ani
 rate
 on
 thi
 floor
.
the
 onli
 alter
 that
 had
 been

made
 wa
 the
 light
, and
 jenna

wa
 not
 at
 all
 sure
 that
 she

approv
.
the
 famili
 seem
 to
 have
 a
 bia

toward
 pink
.
the

 light
 in
 the

stone
 wall
 were
 bedeck
 with
 pink

silk
 shade
.
the
 cloth
 on
 the
 small
 round

tabl
 were
 pink
 in
 anoth
 shade
.
the
 flower
, she
 note
, were

not
 real
, and
, glanc
 at

marguerit
, she
 wa
 amus
 to
 note

that
 the
 dark
, fine
 arch

brow
 were
 arch
 even
 further
 with

faint
 disapprov
.
it
 wa
 cool
 and
 dark
, the

stone
 floor
 scatter
 with
 rug
,
and
 it
 wa
 not
 long
 befor

jenna
 decid
 it
 wa
 too
 cool
 and

too
 dark
.
the
 latter
 problem
 wa
 taken
 care

of
 as
 a
 waiter
 came
 to
 show

them
 to
 their
 tabl
; he
 lit
 a

pink
 candl
 and
 jenna
 suddenli
 felt

amus
, her

she
 shot
 a

look
 awai
 veri
 speedili
 when
 she

found
 hi

 on
 the
 sudden
 curv

of
 her

"the

he
 murmur
 sardon

he
 wa
 alwai
 quick
 to
 appreci

her

, jenna
 note
 uneasili
,
and
 the
 excel
 compani
 soon
 came

thread
 through
 the

 to
 join

them
.
she
 didn

 need
 to
 be
 told

that
 thi

 claudin
 becaus
 the

 swept
 up

bent
 to

" ch

"what

alain
 look
 at
 her
 with
 a
 great

 of
 indulg
, but
 jenna
 wa

busili
 reorganis
 her
 thought
.
so
 he
 hadn

 been
 here
 thi

morn
 while
 she
 wa
 forc
 her

 through
 the
 wood

she
 had
 assum
 that
 he
 had
 come

to

 as
 soon
 as
 he
 had
 finish

chastis
 her

 clearli
 he

hadn

"you

 when

doe

thi
 appeal
 to
 alain

 had

marguerit
 smile
 with
 similar

indulg

"he

she
 agre

"it

"well

claudin

"sai

"it

 point
 out

with
 the
 same
 teas
 that
 wa

begin
 to
 set
 jenna
's

"we

"ye

"you
're
 not

he
 wasn

jenna
's
 face
 froze
.
here
 wa
 anoth
 person
 who
 knew

her
 father
 better
 than
 she
 did
,
a
 person
 who
 wa

 out

with

she
 said
 briefli
.
"and

"jenna

claudin
 didn

 seem
 to
 know

that
 thi
 wa
 a
 cruel
 dig
 at

jenna
; she
 onli
 appear
 to

note
 the

 with

that
 her

she

it
 would

 difficult
 to

imagin
 thi

 run
 from

to

 and
 back

 without

she
 wa
 smaller

 she
 wa
 so

healthi

 that
 the

gave
 her
 an

she
 wa
 pretti

 crispli

dark

at

 her

when
 she
 had

there
 had
 been
 a
 cold

 wa

quickli
 hidden

she
 did
 not
 encourag

her

 made

 plain

"shall

 wheedl
, and

alain
 sat
 back
 with

"if

"oh

it

it
 also
 put

she
 shot

and
, when

she
 realis
 that
 she
 wa
 much
 too

awar

, but
 thi

she
 had
 been

 awar
 of
 him

sinc
 their
 first
 meet
 and
 he

knew
 it
.
he
 wa
 right
 when
 he
 had
 said

that

the
 feel

 each
 time

thei

when
 at

 he
 went
 out
 as
 the

dusk
 wa

 she
 wa
 veri

glad
 to
 see
 him
 go
.
at
 least
 she
 could
 breath
 properli
 when

he
 wa
 out

.
as
 hi

 went

 she
 gave

a
 great
 sigh
 of

 and

marguerit
 shot

"he

jenna
 had
 doubt
 about
 that

now
, but
 she
 let
 it
 go
.
all
 the

, she
 wa
 intrigu
.
she
 want
 to

and
 he
 had
 told

she
 wa
 pleas
 when
 marguerit

in
 view
 of
 alain
's
 remark
 on
 the

subject
 she
 felt
 quit
 honour
,
even
 though
 she
 wa
 onli
 given
 small

task
.
it
 gave
 her
 the
 chanc
 to
 be

with
 marguerit
, though
, and
 thei

talk
 quit
 easili
 as
 thei
 move

around
 the
 kitchen
.
"what
 wa
 alain

like
?" she
 ask
 at
 last

when
 her
 desir
 to
 know
 about

alain
 overcam
 her
 shyness
.
"to

like
 alain
 in
 mani

, but

hi
 hard
 show

he
 did
 not

he

after
 that
 i
 veri
 much

 if

alain
 could
 have
 taken

but
 into

even
 befor

"until

," jenna
 finish
 for

her
 softli
.
"i
 did
 not

about

 assur

her
 worriedli
, but
 jenna
 smile
 and

got
 on
 with
 her
 task
.
"it

.
none
 of

"nor

she
 stop
 and
 bit
 her
 lip

anxious
.
"we
 will
 stop
 talk
 about

it
."
"it
's
 all
 right
," jenna

said
 quietli
.
"perhap
 i
 would
 have

 i
'd
 known

him

"jenna
...!"
whatev
 marguerit
 had
 been
 about
 to

sai
 she
 did
 not
 continu
 and
 later

chang
 the
 subject
 with
 firm

that
 told
 jenna
 she
 would
 not
 bring

it
 up
 again
.
there
 wa
 a
 thread
 of
 affect

grow
 between
 them
 and
 she
 knew

that
 as
 well
 as
 jenna
 did
.
appar
 she
 wa
 not
 prepar
 to

risk
 thi
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 plead

russel
's
 caus
.
jenna
 wa
 glad
.
the
 ghost
 were
 veri
 close
 to
 the

surfac
 here
 in
 the
 dordogn
,
here
 in
 thi
 hous
, and
 jenna

wa
 torn
 in
 mani
 wai
.
there
 wa
 the
 memori
 of
 past

hurt
 --- great
 hurt
 and

anger
.
there
 wa
 also
 thi
 feel
 that

ani
 attempt
 to
 search
 into
 her

father
's
 past
 would
 be
 disloy
 to

her
 mother
.
thing
 were
 best
 left
 alon
.
there
 wa
 also
 alain
, who
 fill

her
 thought
 for
 most
 of
 the

time
.
after
 dinner
 thei
 talk
 about
 lot

of
 thing
, each
 carefulli
 skirt

the
 thing
 uppermost
 in
 their
 mind
.
marguerit
 told
 jenna
 that
 perhap

final
 alain
 would
 marri
 claudin
;
at
 ani
 rate
, she
 ad
 with

amus
, he
 would
 if
 it
 wa

left
 to
 claudin
.
jenna
 found
 that
 she
 didn
't

want
 to
 know
, in
 fact
 she

didn
't
 want
 to
 know
 to
 an

almost
 frantic
 extent
.
on
 more
 night
 here
 and
 thei
 would

all
 go
 back
 to
 pari
 and
 she

would
 go
 home
 to
 england
.
it
 would
 be
 the
 end
 of
 her

time
 be
 in
 ani
 wai
 close
 to

alain
.
when
 marguerit
 went
 to
 bed
,
jenna
 went
 too
, but
 sleep
 wa

far
 from
 her
.
it
 had
 been
 a
 dai
 of
 mani

upset
.
twice
 alain
 had
 kiss
 her
.
she
 had
 face
 a
 certain
 amount
 of

humili
 again
 at
 the
 hand
 of

that
 wretch
 mari
, but
 the
 thing

that
 stai
 in
 her
 mind
 wa
 the

feel
 of
 alain
's
 arm
 and
 the

tang
 of
 hi
 skin
.
it
 wa
 quit
 ridicul
 and
 so
 veri

obviou
 that
 he
 wa
 do
 thi
 for

mani
 dubiou
 reason
 of
 hi
 own
.
he
 wa
 not
 a
 man
 to
 give
 wai

easili
 and
 he
 had
 clearli
 set
 hi

heart
 on
 make
 her
 recognis
 her

father
.
it
 wa
 all
 for
 marguerit
's

sake
.
except
 for
 the
 littl
 mean
 about

claudin
, hi
 nasti
 trick
 of

kiss
 her
 when
 he
 knew
 that

mari
 would
 see
 them
.
everyth
 he
 had
 done
 that
 had

seem
 at
 all
 kind
 had
 been
 part

of
 a
 plan
 to
 make
 her
 face
 her

past
 for
 hi
 mother
's
 sake
.
no
 doubt
 it
 would
 give
 marguerit
 some

comfort
 to
 be
 abl
 to
 be
 warm

and
 friendli
 with
 russel
's

daughter
, but
 it
 wa
 too
 big

a
 price
 to
 pai
.
jenna
 knew
 it
.
she
 got
 up
 and
 put
 on
 her

dress
-gown
.
marguerit
 wa

 and
 jenna

crept
 downstair
 in
 the
 silent
 hous

and
 made
 her
 wai
 to

to
 fix
 herself

 milki
 drink
.
her

 seem
 to
 be
 all
 around

her
 in
 thi
 hous
.
not
 as
 much
 as
 he
 had
 been
 in

the
 studio
, but
 he
 wa
 here
 all

.
she
 kept
 rememb
 that
 he
 had

walk
 in

, sat
 in

the

she
 took
 her

 after

a
 while
 she
 put

and
 went
 slowli
 across

 look
 at

the

somehow
 she
 knew

and
 she
 knew
 it
 wa

 although

her
 knowledg
 of
 art
 wa
 skimpi
 to

sai
 the

.
it
 wa
 marguerit
 as
 she
 had
 been

mani
 year
 ago
, and
 jenna
 saw

what
 her
 father
 had
 seen
, what

she
 herself
 saw
 now
 --- the

 of

, of
 calm

good
 humour
.
he
 had
 paint
 hi
 best
 friend
 and

hi

 and
 jenna
 couldn

.
she
 wa
 so
 wrap

she

so
 earli
 in
 the
 year
, jenna

manag
 to
 get
 an
 even
 golden

tan
.
she
 gain
 a
 few
 necessari
 pound
 in

weight
 too
, and
 it
 wa
 all
 due

to
 the
 quiet
 and
 calm
 of
 the

hous
, marguerit
's
 sooth
 presenc

and
 an
 entir
 unexpect
 sens
 of

peac
 and

gradual
 she
 wheedl
 her
 wai
 into

the
 kitchen
 and
 began
 to
 learn
 the

art
 of
 french
 cook
 from

alain

there

each

 she
 listen
 for
 alain

it
 wa
 entir
 against
 her
 will

and
 utterli
 ridicul
, but
 she

could
 not
 seem
 to
 stop
 do

it
.
reluctantli
 she
 admit
 that
 she
 want

to
 see
 him
 all
 the
 time
.
it
 wa
 the
 onli
 thing
 that
 made

her
 restless
, and
 marguerit

notic
.
"todai

," she

comment
 on
 morn
.
"we

i
 expect

"oh

," jenna
 put
 in

quickli
.
"i
've
 even
 forgotten

 ad
 with
 a

.
"at

"realli

you
 gave

alain

 look
 guilti
 herself

and
 jenna
 hurri
 to
 correct
 her
.
"i

you

"you

"all
 the

, how
 long
 can

you
 stai
 befor
 you
 lose
 thi

of
 your

"mayb
 on
 more

in
 fact
, there
 wa
 no
 chanc

of
 lose
 her
 job
, but
 sooner

or
 later
 she
 would
 have
 to
 go

and
 it
 seem
 a
 good
 idea
 to

lai
 down
 a
 time
 now
.
that
 wai
 marguerit
 would
 not
 be

disappoint
.
"then
 we
 must
 make
 the
 most

of
 it
," she
 said
 briskli
.
"i
 have
 some
 shop
 to

do
 and
 you
 have
 not
 been
 to

the

 at

.
we
'll
 go
 immedi
 after

breakfast

"on
 foot
?"
jenna
 look
 at
 her
 wryli
.
the
 nearest
 town
 wa
 some
 distanc

awai
 and
 alain
 had
 driven
 off
 in

the
 car
.
" mai

i
 have
 a
 car
 here
.
as
 far
 as
 i
 know
 it
 work
 as
 well
 as

ever

the
 car
 in
 question
 wa
 a
 littl

renault
, and
 jenna
 wa

interest
 as
 marguerit
 led
 her

to
 the
 garag
 later
 and
 open

it
 up
.
appar
 it
 wa
 also
 a
 gener

storehous
 for
 thing
 from
 the

hous
, and
 by
 the
 wall
 wa
 a

bicycl
.
"that
 is
 alain

marguerit
 said
 as
 jenna
 inspect

it
 with
 interest
.
"it
 must
 be
 year
 sinc

.
he
 is
 not
 so
 light

 now
 as

 much

respons

there
 wa
 a
 time
, though
,
when
 everi
 weekend
 he
 would
 be

off
 on
 that
 cycl

it
 is
 not
 a

 for
 the

amateur
," she
 ad
 warningli

as
 jenna
 ei
 it
 with
 glee
.
"it
 is
 a
 fast
 race

machin
."
jenna
 could
 see
 that
 it
 wa
,
but
 she
 made
 a
 note
 to
 sneak

in
 here
 when
 she
 had
 a

minut
 and
 try
 it
 out
.
it
 wa
 year
 sinc
 she
 had
 ridden

a
 bike
 too
, not
 sinc
 she
 had

been
 at
 school
 and
 had
 cycl
 home

each
 dai
.
the
 thought
 came
 into
 her
 mind

that
, while
 she
 had
 been
 do

that
, alain
 had
 been
 here
,
go
 out
 on
 hi
 splendid
 machin
,
come
 home
 to
 talk
 to
 hi
 mother

and
 to
  her
  father
.
the
 pictur
 wa
 clearli
 in
 her

head
, but
 it
 brought
 none
 of

the
 old
 bitter
, becaus
 now
 she

wa
 see
 alain
, imagin
 him
,
and
 it
 wipe
 awai
 the
 old

grief
.
it
 wa
 true
 --- wall
 were

crumbl
 and
 she
 had
 better
 make

sure
 that
 new
 on
 were
 not

built
.
especi
 on
 she
 could
 not

scale
.
her
 cheek
 grew
 pink
 at
 the
 thought

of
 even
 try
 and
 marguerit

look
 at
 her
 curious
, mistak

her
 express
.
"i
 do
 not
 suppos
 that
 alain

would
 be
 annoi
 it
 you
 tri
 out

hi
 old

," she
 said

quickli
.
"i
 onli
 meant
 that
 it

would
 not

 to
 go
 on

the

.
you
 would
 need
 perhap
 more
 skill

than
 you
 have
."
"i
'm
 sure
 i

would
."
jenna
 grin
 at
 her
 and
 got

into
 the
 car
, look
 around
 with

pleasur
 as
 marguerit
 revers
 from

the
 garag
 and
 turn
 to
 the

track
.
the
 old
 hous
 wa
 onc
 again
 golden

and
 mellow
 in
 the
 sun
.
daili
 the
 heat
 grew
 and
 daili
 she

felt
 more
 and
 more
 reluct
 to

leav
 here
.
she
 wa
 make
 peac
 with
 herself

and
 with
 her

 and
 suddenli

she
 want
 to
 tell
 alain
, to

thank
 him
 for
 forc
 thi

bitter
 at
 into
 the
 soul
 and
 at

last
 her
 soul
 wa
 clear
,
calm
.
with
 a
 guilti
 start
 she
 rememb

she
 had
 not
 phone
 glyn
 sinc

pari
.
"when
 we
 come
 back
 i
 must

phone
 home
," she
 told

marguerit
.
"of
 cours
,  ma
 ch
&egrav

, whenev
 you
 want
 to

jenna
 smile
 and
 sank
 into

silenc
.
the
 word
 "home
" just

didn
't
 seem
 to
 ring
 true
 ani

more
.
for
 now
 she
 wa
 torn
 between
 two

place
 and
 it
 wa
 not
 the
 thought

of
 her
 father
 that
 bound
 her
 to

thi
 place
.
it
 wa
 the
 chanc
 that
 she
 would

see
 alain
, that
 he
 would
 suddenli

come
 with
 hi
 dark
, sardon

smile
, hi
 caustic
 comment
 and

hi
 unexpect
 kiss
.
thei
 turn
 south
 thi
 time
 and

soon
 jenna
 wa
 amus
 and
 intrigu

to
 see
 huge
 gaggl
 of
 gees
 in

field
, move
 about
 almost
 as

on
 and
 honk
 loud
 enough
 to

be
 heard
 over
 the
 nois
 of
 the

car
.
"the
 gees
 make
 much

nois
," marguerit
 remark
,
frown
 at
 them
 as
 she
 sped

past
.
"thei
 ar
 also
 often
 quit

fierc
."
"i
've
 never
 seen
 so

mani
," jenna
 remark
, turn

in
 her
 seat
 to
 look
 back
.
"thi

it
 rather
 wipe
 the
 smile
 from

jenna
's

.
her
 english
 mind
 could
 not
 contempl

the
 forc
-feed
 of
 these
 gees
, no

matter
 how
 fierc
 thei
 were
.
"there
 ar
 also

.
you
 know
 what
 thei
 ar
?"
"a

 of

jenna
 made
 a

, and

marguerit
 laugh
 at
 her
 express
.
" ma

it
 led
 marguerit
 on
 to
 the
 art
 of

cook
, and
 jenna
 wa
 content

to
 sit
 and
 listen
 to
 the
 sooth

sound
 of
 her
 voic
.
now
 that
 marguerit
 wa
 confid
 with

her
, her
 english
 had
 surfac

again
.
no
 doubt
 she
 had
 spoken
 english
 with

russel
 and
 it
 wa
 all
 come

back
 to
 her
.
the
 town
 wa
 small
 and
 neat
,
typic
 of
 the
 town
 of
 the

area
, almost
 all
 of
 it
 built

around
 the
 central
 squar
, which

wa
 shade
 by
 high
 tree
.
jenna
 want
 to
 roam
 off
 by

herself
 and
 do
 a
 littl
 window
-gaze
,
but
 marguerit
 took
 her
 arm
 in
 a

surprisingli
 strong
 grip
.
"no
!
if
 anyth
 should
 happen
 to
 you
,
alain
 would
 be
 furiou
 with

we
 have
 just
 got

again

 i
 cannot

take
 the

"i
'm
 not

!"
jenna
 laugh
.
"i
'm
 quit
 capabl
 of
 take

care
 of
 myself
."
"you
 do
 not
 speak

french
," marguerit
 said

triumphantli
, and
 jenna
 had
 to

agre
.
when
  would
 peopl
 stop
 take

care
 of
 her
?
thei
 had
 never
 even
 tri
 it
 until

she
 had
 first
 seen
 alain
 and
 now

it
 seem
 that
 everi
 step
 she
 took

wa
 to
 be
 supervis
.
"i
 came
 to
 franc
 alon
,
you
 know
," she
 point
 out

firmli
, but
 alain
's
 mother
 had

her
 there
 too
.
"but
 alain
 wa

,  n
'est

he
 instruct

 to

 finish
 with
 a

look
 that
 said
 it
 wa
 no

argu

"he
 probabl
 think
 i
'm
 an

imbecil
," jenna
 mutter

frustratedli
.
"he
 think
 you
 ar
 a
 littl

delic
," marguerit
 said

comfort
, lead
 her
 to
 a
 stall

in
 the
 open

 market
 that
 wa

well
 stock
 with
 bright
 fruit
 and

fresh
 veget

"it
 is

alain

"alwai
?"
jenna
 look
 at
 her
 in

astonish
, but
 there
 wa
 no

repli
.
marguerit
 wa
 test
 and
 discard

fruit
 and
 veget
 with
 an
 almost

fanat
 zeal
.
the
 great
 french
 cook
 wa
 bui

in
 suppli
 and
 jenna
 knew
 not
 to

interrupt
.
if
 alain
 had
 been
 intrigu
 by
 her

colour
 sinc
 he
 had
 first
 seen

her
 then
 why
 hadn
't
 marguerit
 said

so
?
"alwai
" wa
 an
 odd

choic
 of
 word
, denot
 a
 great

length
 of
 time
.
it
 wa
 probabl
 the
 translat

chapter
 eight

in
 spite
 of
 be
 almost
 tether
 to

marguerit
, jenna
 enjoi
 the
 trip

and
 wa
 reward
 later
 by
 be

instruct
 in

 of
 some

of

happili
 there
 wa
 no

 certainli
 no

even
 her
 call
 to

 had
 been

he
 wa
 back
 to
 hi

quiet
 and
 undemand
, and
 he

admit
 that
 he
 wa

"how

 ad

in

"it

 if

 said

soothingli
.
"i

when
 she
 had
 said
 that
 befor

she
 had
 meant
 it
, but
 now
 she

realis
 she
 wa
 ly
; she
 wa

want
 to
 make
 him
 feel
 better
 and

she
 wa
 also
 hang
 on
 to
 her

old
 life
 to
 feel
 safe
.
she
 knew
 perfectli
 well
 why
.
her
 thought
 were
 far
 too
 much
 on

alain
 and
 it
 wa
 quit
 ridicul
.
thi
 wa
 a
 busi
 arrang
 and

noth
 more
.
whatev
 alain
's
 plan
, thei
 did

not
 includ
 her
, other
 than
 her

enabl
 him
 to
 see
 hi
 mother

happili
 back
 in
 charg
 of
 her
 own

home
.
as
 to
 the
 kiss
, hadn
't
 he

said
 it
 wa
 becaus
 he
 wa

french
?
perhap
 thei
 didn
't
 take
 thing
 to

 so
 much
.
"i
'll
 be
 back
 in
 a

week
," she
 told
 glyn

firmli
.
"we
'll
 get

as
 he
 rang
 off
 after
 thi

unexpect
 statement
, jenna
 felt
 again

the
 old
 familiar
 tighten
 around

her
 heart
, the
 trap
 feel
,
and
 the
 memori
 of
 alain
's
 arm

came
 surg
 back
 into
 her
 mind
.
have
 felt
 like
 that
 with
 alain
,
how
 would
 she
 feel
 with
 glyn
?
wa
 she
 about
 to
 risk
 the
 rest

of
 her
 life
 for
 safeti
?
she
 wa
 pleasantli
 sleepi
 by
 bedtim
 in

spite
 of
 her
 thought
 and
 for
 onc
 had

a
 dreamless
 sleep
, no
 imag
 of

her
 mother
 to
 distract
 and
 disturb

her
.
now
 it
 wa
 alain
's
 face
 that

surfac
 when
 she
 let
 down
 her

guard
.
her
 last
 thought
 wa
 to
 wonder
 what

life
 would
 have
 been
 like
 had
 she

been
 here
 with
 her
 father
 instead
 of

in
 england
 with
 her
 mother
.
she
 would
 have
 grown
 up
 with

marguerit
's
 calm
 influenc
 around

her
; she
 would
 have
 been
 more

french
 than
 english
.
she
 would
 have
 been
 close
 to

alain
.
it
 wa
 all
 so
 much
 useless

specul
 becaus
, when
 everyth
 wa

truli
 laid
 out
 sensibl
, her

father
 had
 not
 want
 her
.
next
 morn
 jenna
 inspect
 the
 garag

and
 determinedli
 got
 out
 the

bike
.
in
 the
 sunlight
 she
 could
 see
 that

it
 wa
 inde
 a
 rather
 splendid

machin
.
she
 dust
 it
 off
 and
 then
 rather

timidli
 mount
 it
.
the
 fact
 that
 it
 wa
 a
 man
's

bike
 didn
't
 troubl
 her
 too

much
.
she
 wa
 wear
 trouser
 and
 as
 she

kept
 her
 feet
 on
 the
 ground
 she

felt
 reason
 secur
, at
 least
;
she
 kept
 her
 toe
 on
 the
 ground

and
 spent
 a
 rather
 hilari
 time

try
 to
 get
 control
 of
 it
 in

the
 courtyard
, her
 attempt
 bring

marguerit
 out
 with
 word
 of
 advic

and
 wide
 smile
.
when
 alain
's
 mother
 final
 went

insid
 with
 a
 few
 rueful
 shake
 of

her
 head
 and
 a
 pleas
 look
 on

her
 face
, jenna
 decid
 to
 risk

all
.
she
 set
 off
 boldli
 toward
 the

fenc
 and
 onli
 had
 to
 put
 her

feet
 down
 speedili
 onc
.
after
 her
 third
 attempt
 she
 felt

quit
 secur
 and
 rather
 smug
.
not
 smug
 enough
, howev
, to

tackl
 the
 track
.
it
 wa
 not
 the
 thought
 of
 a

fall
 that
 worri
 her
.
as
 far
 as
 she
 knew
, mari
 would
 be

here
 todai
, and
 she
 had
 no

intent
 of
 make
 a
 fool
 of

herself
 and
 allow
 the
 girl
 more

gossip
 to
 tell
 claudin
.
the
 field
 in
 front
 of
 the
 hous
 wa

reason
 flat
 and
 she
 set
 off
 to

tackl
 that
.
no
 doubt
 she
 would
 be
 do
 the

cycl
 irrepar
 damag
, but
 the

urg
 to
 ride
 it
 wa
 too
 strong

to
 be
 deni
.
she
 lift
 it
 over
 the
 fenc

and
 set
 off
 across
 the
 littl

meadow
, gather
 speed
 and
 thoroughli

enjoi
 it
.
the
 gear
 were
 tricki
 and

elabor
, but
 she
 manag
 them

after
 on
 or
 two
 mistak
, and

by
 the
 time
 she
 had
 been
 round

onc
 she
 felt
 veri
 proud
 of

herself
.
the
 whole
 morn
 becam
 encapsul

in
 the
 smell
 of
 grass
, the

sound
 of
 the
 tyre
 and
 the
 wind

blow
 her
 hair
 as
 she
 went
 faster

and
 faster
.
come
 back
 round
 by
 the
 hous
 for

the
 third
 time
, she
 got
 quit

abov
 herself
, and
 the
 bike
 began

to
 wobbl
 alarmingli
 as
 she
 fought

to
 control
 it
.
fail
 miser
, she
 found
 herself

slide
 sidewai
, and
 there
 wa

noth
 she
 could
 do
 but
 laugh
 as

she
 hit
 the
 field
 quit
 hard

and
 bike
 land
 on
 top
 of
 her
.
it
 didn
't
 hurt
.
noth
 could
 have
 hurt
 on
 thi

gloriou
 morn
 and
 she
 had
 quit

forgotten
 about
 mari
 and
 the
 amus

the
 girl
 would
 have
 had
 in
 see

her
.

time

 tell
, jenna
 thought
.
face
 with
 actual
 go
 back
 to

the
 barn
, she
 wa
 not
 now
 so

seren
 about
 it
 as
 she
 had
 been

when
 she
 wa
 ly
 in
 the
 field

and
 gaze
 at
 the
 sky
.
she
 glanc
 at
 the
 sky
 now
 but

quickli
 look
 awai
.
how
 swiftli
 she
 and
 alain
 came
 to

temper
.
it
 wa
 quit
 sad
.
still
, he
 wa
 a
 stranger
 after

all
.
hi
 life
 wa
 not
 like
 her
 and

she
 wa
 simpli
 an
 outsid
 who
 had

been
 forc
 to
 come
 here
.
soon
 she
 would
 go
 and
 he
 would

forget
 all
 about
 her
, except

perhap
 for
 those
 wry
 littl
 moment

when
 he
 would
 rememb
 her
 childish

temper
 and
 smile
 to
 himself
 in

hi
 superior
 wai
.
thi
 time
 there
 wa
 no
 need
 for

him
 to
 forc
 her
 up
 the
 dark

step
 of
 the
 barn
; she
 walk
 in

front
 of
 him
 determinedli
.
noth
 could
 upset
 her
 here
.
she
 told
 herself
 that
 veri
 firmli
,
and
 when
 alain
 swung
 the
 door

to
 the
 studio
 wide
 to
 allow
 her

to
 enter
 jenna
 walk
 in
 without

hesit
.
she
 wa
 readi
 now
 for
 the
 sight

of
 the
 chair
, the
 pipe
, the

feel
 that
 her
 father
 had
 onli

pop
 out
 for
 a
 minut
 and

would
 be
 back
 befor
 she
 could

leav
.
thi
 time
 too
 she
 walk
 around

the
 room
 and
 studi
 the

paint
.
mani
 were
 still
 unfram
 and
 she

had
 to
 admit
 that
 she
 love

them
.
the
 colour
, the
 form
 and
 intens

feel
 of
 light
 and
 pleasur
 wee

exactli
 her
 own
 tast
.
it
 wa
 odd
 to
 think
 that
 even

without
 hi
 talent
 she
 had
 inherit

thi
 from
 her
 father
.
there
 were
 two
 easel
, on
 with

an
 unfinish
 pictur
 of
 a
 town
 and

the
 other
 hold
 a
 paint
 on

a
 larg
 canva
, but
 it
 wa
 not

possibl
 to
 see
 it
.
a
 dark
 cloth
 had
 been
 thrown
 over

it
, cover
 it
 complet
.
"what
's
 that
?"
she
 look
 at
 alain
 and
 wait
 for

hi
 permiss
 to
 uncov
 the

paint
.
so
 far
 she
 had
 felt
 veri
 littl

becaus
 she
 had
 been
 well

prepar
, but
 she
 did
 not
 have

the
 necessari
 audac
 to
 simpli
 whisk

the
 cloth
 awai
.
thi
 wa
 somehow
 still
 alain

she
 had
 been
 left
 befor
 when

 eight
 year

if
 she
 allow

 go
 home
 to

 to

take
 up
 the
 thread
 of

and
 forget

she
 stop
 for

 and

look
 out
 at

she

he
 had
 rescu
 her
 in

 had
 swept
 awai
 the

 and
 the

 he

had

he
 had

she
 had
 turn

 him
 eagerli
,
warm
 by
 hi
 passion

it

 she

could

 after

and
 what
 about

she
 did

the
 ride
 to

 next
 dai
 wa

not

 most
 comfort
 of

jenna
 sat
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the

car
 with
 marguerit
.
she
 want
 to
 leav
 alain
's
 mother

with
 the

 best

 and

she
 knew
 perfectli
 well
 that
 if
 she

sat
 with
 alain
 there
 would
 be
 onli

brood
 silenc
.
alain
 had
 been
 brood
 sinc
 the

night
 befor
, and
 although
 marguerit

had
 certainli
 notic
 she
 had
 kept

quiet
.
even
 so
, there
 wa
 not
 much

that
 could
 be
 said
, other
 than

polit
 convers
.
both
 of
 them
 were
 awar
 of

alain
's
 black
 anger
 and
 marguerit

wa
 feel
 the
 sorrow
 of
 leav

her
 own
 hous
.
she
 refus
 to
 allow
 jenna
 to

feel
 guilti
, though
, and
 from
 time
 to

time
 she
 smile
 across
 and
 pat

jenna
's
 hand
.
from
 time
 to
 time
, too
, jenna
 caught

alain
's
 dark
 ey
 watch
 her

through
 the
 drive
 mirror
, and
 she

wa
 greatli
 reliev
 when
 thei
 began

to
 skirt
 pari
.
"can

 be

 off
 at

the
 airport
?" she
 wa
 glad

to
 ask
 as
 the
 sign
 came

up
.
she
 want
 to
 be

.
"i
 must
 get
 my

 home

first
," alain
 inform
 her

bleakli
.
"in

look
 up

 it
 will
 be

easi
 to
 drop

there
 wa
 no
 argu
 with
 that

and
 jenna
 had
 vision
 of
 alain

simpli
 give
 her
 the
 ride
 and

leav
 her
 to
 it
.
not
 that
 she
 would
 be
 unabl
 to

manag
, but
 she
 would
 have
 like

to
 leav
 in
 happier
 circumst

there
 wa
 too
 much
 anger
 between

them
, also
 too
 much
 unhappi
 on

her
 part
.
she
 did
 not
 want
 to
 leav

alain
.
she
 wa
 will
 to
 admit
 that

to
 herself

to
 leav
 him

 wa
 even

wors

on
 the
 outsid
 he
 wa

polit

 underneath
 he
 wa

smoulder
 with
 rage

she
 wa
 surpris
 how
 well
 she
 knew

him
 and
 she
 realis
 he
 wa

perfectli
 right
 about

she
 had

 of

her
 long
 associ

lemarchand
, but
 it
 wa
 not

that
.
it
 wa
 an
 instinct
 reach
 out

to
 him
 even
 when
 he
 wa
 a

stranger
.
he
 wa
 no
 stranger
 now
 and
 leav

him
 wa
 hard
, more
 bitter
 to

her
 than
 anyth
 had
 ever
 been
.
the
 beauti
 hous
 look
 just
 the

 and
 not

 plan
 for

alain

 and
 she

need
 both

 need
  him

.
it
 wa
 not
 possibl
 to
 just
 sit

in

 and
 wait
.
marguerit
 had
 to
 be
 settl
 and

alain
 wa

here
 in

"do

 began
 to
 make

it
 look
 as
 if
 the

 would
 be

full

there
 would
 be
 nobodi
 to

in

 becaus
 she
 had
 not

it

 onli
 with

he
 lift

 off

crush
 her

there
 wa
 so
 much
 forc
 in

 that
 jenna
 felt
 faint

blood
 rush
 to

perhap
 she

she
 knew

 perhap
 some

 would
 be

will

to

 of
 her

 she
 would

it
 meant

 to
 her
 now
 becaus

she
 would
 never

thei
 still
 had
 more
 right
 than

she
 did

 she
 desper

want
 someth

 to

her
 memori
 of

 were

and
 she
 need
 someth
 concret
 to

build

she
 need
 it
 more
 than

that

in

 deep

down
 that

she

 alreadi
 told
 glyn
 that

 and
 he
 had
 taken
 it

better
 than
 she
 had
 thought
 he

would
.
he
 wa
, after
 all
, not
 a

passion
 man
, and
 the
 new

jenna
 who
 return
 from

 had

rather
 alarm
 him
.
there
 wa
 a
 blaze
 in
 her
 ey

that
 had
 not

 befor
 and

he
 could
 see
 at
 onc
 that

thei
 had

 jenna
 veri

much

she
 imagin

 she
 felt
 the

.
thei

school
 wa
 not
 the

 either
,
becaus
 jenna
 found
 it
 hard
 to
 keep

her
 mind
 from
 wing
 back
 to

franc
 and
 alain
.
sometim
 she
 came
 back
 to
 the

present
 with
 a
 bang
 to
 find

that
 on
 of
 the
 girl
 had
 ask

a
 question
 and
 had
 receiv

 becaus
 jenna

final
 she
 came
 to
 a
 decis
 and

went
 to
 see
 mr
 constantin
.
she
 would
 have
 to
 leav
.
she
 found
 herself
 pour
 out
 her

unhappi
 to
 that
 odd
 but
 kind

ladi
 and
 when
 she
 had
 finish

the
 headmistress
 sat
 back
 and
 look

at
 her
 sympathet
.
"go

 advis
.
"you

"i

"follow

she
 knew
 where
 it
 would
 lead
 her

and
 she
 also
 knew
 it
 would
 bring

grief
.
alain
 had
 been
 right
, though
,
when
 he
 said
 she
 would
 final

come
 back
 and
 search
.
she
 had
 left
 so
 much
 undon
.
she
 had
 never
 even
 ask
 if
 there

wa
 a
 photograph
 of
 her
 father
,
and
 she
 suppos
 thei
 had
 been
 so

care
 not
 to
 upset
 her
 that
 thei

had
 never
 offer
 on
.
she
 must
 go
 back
 to
 the

dordogn
, back
 to
 marguerit
.
insid
 she
 knew
 she
 would
 also
 be

search
 for
 alain
, but
 she
 thrust

that
 thought
 awai
 becaus
 there
 would

be
 noth
 there
 that
 belong
 to

her
.
a
 month
 wa
 a
 long
 time
.
he
 would
 have
 put
 her
 from
 hi

mind
.
the
 law
 would
 be
 take
 it
 state

cours
 and
 perhap
 on
 dai
 she

would
 have
 to
 sign
 document
, but

as
 yet
 there
 had
 been
 no
 word
 from

franc
 --- even
 marguerit
 had
 not

written
 --- and
 jenna
 felt
 veri

much
 alon
.
the
 farm
 look
 just
 the
 same
.
jenna
 pull
 up
 in
 the
 small

courtyard
 and
 sat
 for
 a
 moment

look
 at
 it
.
there
 were
 more
 flower
 now
 and

the
 sunlight
 wa
 stronger
.
the
 feel
 wa
 back
 that
 at

ani
 moment
 alain
 would
 come
, but

she
 knew
 it
 wa
 mere
 dream
.
she
 had
 brought
 her
 car
 thi

time
, cross
 by
 ferri
 and

face
 the
 terror
 of
 the
 pari

ring

, but
 she
 need
 her

thing
 with

 and
 thi
 wa
 the

onli
 wai
 to
 do
 it
.
there
 wa
 nobodi
 at
 all
 here
.
as
 jenna
 step
 out
 of
 the

there
 wa
 onli
 silenc
 and
 she

frown
 at
 her
 own
 stupid

of
 cours
 marguerit
 would
 not
 be
 here

unless
 she
 had
 alreadi
 found
 a

companion
; alain
 would
 not
 have

allow
 it
.
it
 would
 have
 been
 sensibl
 to
 have

got
 in
 touch
, but
 she
 had
 been

desper
 to
 get
 back
 and
 everi

mile
 of
 the
 road
 from
 pari
 had

been
 singingli
 bittersweet
.
now
 there
 wa
 noth
, no
 wai

of
 even

 the
 place
.
a
 sound
 had
 her
 spin
 round
 and

she
 found
 herself
 look
 into
 the

astonish
 ey
 of
 mari
 as
 the

girl
 slid
 from

she
