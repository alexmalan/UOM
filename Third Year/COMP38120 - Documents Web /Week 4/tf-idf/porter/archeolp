what
 is
 archaeolog

the
 mean
 of
 archaeolog

when
 peopl
 think
 of
 archaeolog
,
thei
 tend
 to
 think
 of
 excav
,
particularli
 those
 in
 distant
 land
 such

as
 egypt
 and
 greec
.
thei
 might
 think
 of
 glass
-case

collect
 of
 curio
, but
 thei

rare
 think
 about
 the
 old
 hous

next
 door
, the
 ridg
 and

mound
 in
 the
 field
 down
 the

road
, or
 the
 bit
 of
 old

potteri
 that
 thei
 dig
 up
 in
 the

garden
.
yet
 archaeolog
 includ
 all
 of

these
.
archaeolog
 is
 often
 consid
 as
 a

branch
 of
 histori
, and
 to
 some

extent
 thi
 is
 true
.
histori
 is
 the
 studi
 of
 the
 past

us
 document
 and
 inscript
 as

evid
, and
 historian
 have
 record

and
 interpret
 event
 from
 the

earliest
 dai
 of
 write
 up
 to
 the

present
 dai
.
archaeolog
, on
 the
 other
 hand
,
is
 the
 studi
 of
 the
 past
 us

object
 and
 other
 excav
 evid
 as

the
 main
 sourc
 of
 data
.
thi
 allow
 the
 studi
 of
 peopl

without
 ani
 form
 of
 write
, as
 well

as
 of
 liter
 civil
.
almost
 anyth
 can
 be
 us
 to
 shed

light
 on
 the
 past
: the

foundat
 of
 build
 can
 show
 what

sort
 of
 hous
 peopl
 live
 in
;
the
 remain
 of
 tool
 show
 how
 thei

work
; anim
 bone
 and
 plant

remain
 show
 what
 thei
 at
; and

pollen
, snail
 shell
 and
 the

remain
 of
 tree
 and
 plant
 can

indic
 the
 type
 of
 climat
 and

veget
 at
 the
 time
.
what
 archaeolog
 cannot
 do
 is
 tell

us
 the
 name
 of
 the
 peopl
 and

what
 great
 deed
 thei
 did
, how

thei
 influenc
 each
 other
, and
 what

thei
 thought
 and
 believ
 in

--- these
 ar
 thing
 that
 onli

about
