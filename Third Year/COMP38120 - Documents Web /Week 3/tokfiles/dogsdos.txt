Abstract
Humans share aspects of their facial affect with other species such as 
dogs. Here we asked whether untrained human observers with and without dog 
experience are sensitive to these aspects and recognize dog affect with 
better-than-chance accuracy. Additionally, we explored similarities in the 
way observers process dog and human expressions. The stimulus material 
comprised naturalistic facial expressions of pet dogs and human infants 
obtained through positive (i.e., play) and negative (i.e., social 
isolation) provocation. Results extend existing work on cross-species 
similarities in facial emotions and provide evidence that these 
similarities are naturally exploited when humans interact with dogs.

Dog expressions were collected from 33 dogs (Table 1) that visited a large 
public dog run together with their owners. The dogs were videotaped using a 
Canon HF 10 High Definition video recorder. In the positive condition, a 
dog was presented with a piece of food or its favorite toy depending on 
whether the owner reported the dog to be food or play motivated. This 
condition derived from prior work demonstrating a link between reward, joy, 
and motivation [26]. The baseline image was selected from the period before 
the dog was exposed to the treat. The affective image was selected after 
the owner initiated a movement to deliver the treat, but before the dog 
received and consumed the treat. In the negative condition, the dog was 
placed in a crate located in a deserted area of the dog run. This condition 
was modeled on the finding that social separation produces sadness [20]. 
The crate was 106 Lx71 Wx79 H cm in size and appropriate for all the dogs 
used in this study (i.e., they could stand and move around in it 
comfortably). The baseline image was taken while the dog owner was still 
visible to the dog. The affective image was taken after the owner had left 
and while the dog was showing known signs of distress (i.e., 
whining/pawing, licking, heavy panting). The dog was left alone in the 
crate for 5 minutes only.

Visual inspection of the reaction time data suggested a comparable priming 
effect for human and dog faces (Figure 2). Statistical analysis confirmed 
this impression and revealed a significant Prime x Target interaction 
(F(1,60) = 25.5, p<.0001) that was qualified by a three-way interaction 
including Sex (F(1,60) = 5.5, p<.05), but not Species (p>.3). The Prime x 
Target x Species x Dog Ownership interaction merely approached significance 
(F(1,60) = 3.4, p = .07). An exploration of the Prime x Target interaction in 
men was significant (F(1,30) = 4.3, p<.05). However, follow-up comparisons 
were only marginally significant or non-significant for positive (F(1,30) = 
3.7, p = .06) and negative primes (p>.2), respectively. An exploration of 
the Prime x Target interaction in women was also significant (F(1,30) = 
23.8, p<.0001; Figure 3). Additionally, women responded faster to positive 
than to negative words following positive primes (F(1,30) = 9.3, p<.01) and 
they responded faster to negative than to positive words following negative 
primes (F(1,30) = 13.3, p<.001).
